"Recipe Name: Soft Cheesy Pretzel. Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups flour, all-purpose, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 tablespoons margarine or butter, 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, mild shredded, 2 ounces, 23 cup milk, 1 large eggs beaten, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, Instructions: Combine first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl; cut in margarine with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cheese and milk, stirring until dry ingredients are just moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead about 12 times. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a 12x8-inch rectangle. Cut dough lengthwise into eight 1-inch strips. Twist each into a pretzel shape; brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt. Place on lightly greased baking sheets and bake at 400 for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool pretzels for a few minutes on wire racks; serve pretzels warm. Makes about 16 soft pretzels. Source(s): http://southernfood. about. com/od/appetiz... Pretzels are made from a yeast dough- if you change the type of leavener, you will change the texture of your pretzel. Certainly you can experiment with baking powder or baking soda and an acid, or if youre really determined to get closer to the same recipe, you can start your own culture-read up on making your own starter and see if you want to spend the time. Im thinking you just want to make pretzels but have no yeast in the house? Source(s): professional chef training The Basics By S. John Ross Sourdough bread is bread made without added yeast. By making a \\""starter\\"" in which wild yeast can grow, the sourdough baker can raise bread naturally, as mankind did for thousands and thousands of years before a packet of yeast was an available convenience at the local market. Not all sourdough is sour-tasting; Amish Friendship Bread and other types of live-yeast breads are also sourdough. To become a sourdough baker, all you need are some basic ingredients (flour, water, salt, and sugar), some basic tools (a mixing bowl, an oven, and a baking sheet), and a basic interest. This page is for the novice sourdough baker, but assumes that the reader is familiar with regular yeast-based baking. If you can make bread, you can make sourdough bread. There are only a few simple steps to becoming a sourdough baker. First, you must create a starter: This is a bubbly batter that you keep in your fridge. The starter is mixed into a dough, and it causes the bread to rise. Bake and serve. Yum! Creating Your Starter The novel thing about sourdough baking is that it requires that you keep something alive in your fridge. I think of my starter as a pet, kept and fed so that Sandra and I will have all the bread we need. Sourdough \\""starter\\"" is a batter of flour and water, filled with living yeast and bacteria. The yeast and bacteria form a stable symbiotic relationship, and (as long as you keep the starter fed) can live for centuries, a thriving colony of microorganisms. To make sourdough bread, you blend the starter with some flour and make dough. The yeast propogates, and leavens your bread. This is how you make your starter: Select a container that your \\""pet\\"" will live in. A wide-mouthed glass jar is best. I use a glass jar with a rubber and wireframe seal; you can find these for $2-$4 in any antique or junk shop. A small crock with a loose lid is also great; these can be bought in cheap sets for serving soup. You can also use a rubbermaid or tupperware container. Ive begun starters using the plastic containers that take-out Chinese soup comes in, and then transferred them to jars later! A wide-mouthed mayonnaise or pickle jar will also do just fine. Metallic containers are a bad idea; some of them are reactive and can ruin your starter (for the same reason, avoid using metal utensils to stir your starter). Blend a cup of warm water and a cup of flour, and pour it into the jar. Thats the whole recipe! I use plain, unbleached bread flour most of the time, but Ive had good results with all-purpose and whole-wheat flour, too. If you want, you can add a little commercial yeast to a starter to \\""boost\\"" it. If you do this, sourdough snobs will look down their nose at you - but who cares about snobs? I personally find that (at least here where I live) no yeast \\""boost\\"" is necessary, and I can make \\""real\\"" sourdough with no trouble. But if you are having trouble, go ahead and cheat. I wont tell. Note that starter made with commercial yeast often produces a bread with less distinctive sour flavor than the real thing. Every 24 Hours, Feed the Starter. You should keep the starter in a warm place; 70 to 80 degrees Farenheit is perfect. This allows the yeast already present in the flour (and in the air) to grow rapidly. Temperatures hotter than 100 degrees or so will kill it. You can take comfort from the fact that almost nothing else will do so. The way you feed the starter is to (A) throw away half of it and then (B) add a half-cup of flour and a half-cup of water. Do this every 24 hours. Within three or four days (it can take longer, a week or more, and it can happen more quickly) you should start getting lots of bubbles throughought, and a pleasant sour or beery smell. The starter may start to puff up, too. This is good. Heres the gist: When your starter develops a bubbly froth, it is done. You have succeeded. If this sounds brain-dead simple, thats because it is. People who didnt believe the Earth was round did this for millenia. Refrigerate the Starter. Keep the starter in your fridge, with a lid on it. Allow a little breathing space in the lid. If youre using a mayo or pickle jar, punch a hole in the lid with a nail, that kind of thing. Once the starter is chilled, it needs to be fed only once a week. Realistically, you can get away with less; its important to remember that your starter is a colony of life-forms that are almost impossible to kill (except with extreme heat). Even starving them is difficult. Care and Feeding: Hooch Aside from weekly feeding, the only other thing you need to worry about is hooch. Hooch is a layer of watery liquid (often dark) that contains alchohol. It smells a bit like beer, because it is a bit like beer - but dont drink it! Hooch builds up in your starter, especially in the fridge. Just pour it off or stir it back in. It doesnt hurt anything. If your starter is looking dry, stir it back in. If your starter is plenty wet, pour it off. Just remember that hooch is nothing to worry about! Sourdough Baking Step One: Proofing the Sponge Several hours before you plan to make your dough (recipe below), you need to make a sponge. A \\""sponge\\"" is just another word for a bowl of warm, fermented batter. This is how you make your sponge. Take your starter out of the fridge. Pour it into a large glass or plastic bowl. Meanwhile, wash the jar and dry it. You may also wish to pour boiling water over it, since you dont want other things growing in there with your pet! Add a cup of warm water and a cup of flour to the bowl. Stir well, and set it in a warm place for several hours. This is called \\""proofing,\\"" another word for fermenting. Sourdough bakers have their own language; use it to impress your friends ;) Watch for Froth and and Sniff. When your sponge is bubbly and has a white froth, and it smells a little sour, it is ready. The longer you let the sponge sit, the more sour flavor you will get. The proofing-time varies. Some starters can proof up to frothiness in an hour or two. Some take 6 to 8 hours, or even longer. Just experiment and see how long yours takes. If youre going to bake in the morning, set your sponge out to proof overnight. Sourdough Baking Step Two: The Actual Recipe Of course, there are a lot of recipes for sourdough bread. There are also recipes for sourdough rolls, sourdough pancakes, sourdough pretzels, sourdough bagels, and probably sourdough saltines for all I know. This is the basic recipe I use, though, and its simple and makes a fine bread. Youll need the following: 2 Cups of sponge (proofed starter) 3 Cups of unbleached flour 2 tablespoons of olive oil or softened margarine 4 teaspoons of sugar 2 teaspoons of salt First, lets talk about leftover sponge. You should have some. The leftover sponge is your starter for next time: Put it into the jar, and give it a fresh feed of a half-cup each of flour and warm water. Keep it in the fridge as above; youll have starter again next time. Now, for the recipe: To the sponge, add the sugar, salt, and oil (the oil is optional - you can use softened butter instead, or no oil at all). Mix well, then knead in the flour a half-cup at a time. Knead in enough flour to make a good, flexible bread dough. You can do this with an electric mixer, a bread machine on \\""dough cycle,\\"" or a food processor. You can also do it with a big bowl and your bare hands. Keep in mind that flour amounts are approximate; flour varies in absorbency, and your sponge can vary in wetness. Use your judgement; treat it like ordinary white or french bread dough. Trust your hands and eyes more than the recipe, always. Let the dough rise in a warm place, in a bowl covered loosely with a towel (if youre using a bread machines dough cycle, let it rise in the machine). Note that sourdough rises more slowly than yeast bread; my starter takes about an hour or so, but some starters take much longer. Let the dough double in bulk, just like yeast-bread dough. When a finger poked into the top of the dough creates a pit that doesnt \\""heal\\"" (spring back), youve got a risen dough. Punch the dough down and knead it a little more. Make a loaf and place it on a baking sheet (lightly greased or sprinkled with cornmeal). Slit the top if you like, and cover the loaf with a paper towel and place it in a warm place to rise again, until doubled in bulk. Place the pan with the loaf in your oven, and then turn your oven to 350o Farenheit and bake the bread for 30 to 45 minutes. Do not preheat the oven. The loaf is done when the crust is brown and the bottom sounds hollow when thumped with a wooden spoon. Turn the loaf out onto a cooling rack or a towel and let it cool for an hour before slicing. And thats that. If you double the recipe for two big two-pound loaves of bread, the total price tag will be less than a dollar. Comments and Notes and Ramblings For good rising, I use my oven. Turn the oven on for a minute or so, then turn it off again. This will warm the oven and make it a great environment to raise bread. If you cant comfortably press your hand against the inside of the oven door, the oven is too hot. Let it stand open to cool a bit. Im continually amazed at the elegance of sourdough baking . . . Bread is simple and yet its one of the most satisfying foods there is, and the most fundamental. If any part of the article is unclear, please visit the sourdough section of my FAQ for help. For the sake of my health and good cheer, I am no longer accepting sourdough emails due to regrettable abuses of my preferred open-inbox policy. The good news is that the article and FAQ already include everything Ive learned, so you should have plenty to begin with. Best of luck with it, and most of all remember to have fun, never mind getting messy, and enjoy sharing the results with those you love.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Moon Cakes. Ingredients: 1 1/4 cups sugar, 1/4 plus 1/8 teaspoon citric acid (sour salt), 1/2 cup water, 12 Salted Preserved Eggs (page 101), unboiled, 3 ounces pork fatback, blanched in boiling water for about 1 minute until firm, cooled, and finely diced (about 1/2 cup), 1/2 cup finely diced Char Siu Pork (page 142), 1 Chinese sweet sausage, finely chopped, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 cup roasted sunflower seeds, 2/3 cup chopped toasted walnuts, with any loose bits of skin removed, 3 tablespoons chopped toasted cashews, 2 tablespoons chopped toasted slivered blanched almonds, 1/3 cup sesame seeds, toasted (page 332), 1/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger, 3/4 cup chopped candied citron or fruitcake mix, 1/4 cup drained canned white chunk chicken, flaked, 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, 3 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1/3 cup Chinese sorghum and rose petal liquor (mei kwei lu chiu), 3 tablespoons freshly grated lime zest, or 10 tender young lime leaves (any variety), minced, 1/4 cup canola or other neutral oil, plus extra for shaping, 3 tablespoons Caramel Sauce (page 316), or as needed, 3/4 teaspoon potassium bicarbonate solution (lye water), Sugar syrup, 2 3/4 cups plus about 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting, 3 egg yolks, 2 1/2 teaspoons Caramel Sauce (page 316), Instructions: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, citric acid, and water and let stand for 30 minutes. Then bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the syrup turns pale yellow (the color of canola oil). If the citric acid turns dark yellow during boiling, swirl the pan or stir the contents to distribute. Remove from the heat and pour into a large measuring cup or heatproof bowl. Set the syrup aside for about 4 hours to cool completely. It will thicken and darken a bit as it cools. Then cover with plastic wrap and keep at room temperature. There should be a scant 1 cup syrup. (The syrup can be made up to 3 days in advance and kept at room temperature until using.) Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 250F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Crack each salted egg and separate the yolk from the white, discarding the white and depositing the yolk on the prepared baking sheet. Discard yolks that are liquid, but keep yolks that hold their shape, even if they are partial ones; you can make a double-yolk cake. Once you have enough yolks (either 10 or 12, whole and partial ones combined), stop; the number of yolks needed depends on the size of your mold. Save any left over salted eggs for another use. Bake the egg yolks for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they have lost most of their sheen. You want the yolks to cook sufficiently to hold their shape in the cakes. If the surfaces crack, they have baked a little too long but will be okay in the cakes. Remove the yolks from the oven and let cool. When cool enough to handle, use your fingers or a paring knife to pry the yolks from the baking sheet. Trim each yolk so that it is as round as possible and place on a plate or in a plastic container. Cover and set aside. Put the pork fatback, Char Siu Pork, and sausage in a bowl and use a fork to combine well. Add the powdered sugar and toss to coat the pork and sausage thoroughly. Set aside for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour to marinate. The meat will look wet as it absorbs the sugar. Put the marinated meats and the sunflower seeds, walnuts, cashews, almonds, sesame seeds, crystallized ginger, candied citron, chicken, sugar, and corn syrup into a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Place over medium heat and saute gently for about 10 minutes, or until the pieces of fatback are clear and the sugar has melted. (If you taste some, you should detect just a bit of graininess from the sugar.) Turn off the heat and wait for the bubbling sugar to subside before stirring in the liquor and lime zest. Let cool for 30 minutes before continuing. To shape the filling into balls, line the baking sheet with fresh parchment paper and gather the following: the filling, plastic wrap, the baked yolks, and a scale. Tear off 4 pieces of plastic wrap each about 20 inches long, and fold each piece in half. Put a folded sheet on the scale. Scoop up 1/3 cup of the filling and deposit it on the plastic wrap. Make a depression in the middle, and put an egg yolk in the depression. Top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the filling to achieve the total weight you want: 3 ounces for a 1/2-cup mold, or 3 1/2 ounces for a 2/3-cup mold. Gather up the edges of the plastic wrap and pick up the bundle in one hand. With the other hand, twist and squeeze the plastic to compress the filling into a ball the size of a tangerine (about 2 1/4 inches in diameter). Use some pressure to make sure the elements have stuck together. Undo the plastic and roll the filling onto the prepared baking sheet. Th e ball should hold together as it sits. If it falls apart, squeeze it back into shape. Repeat with the remaining filling, using new pieces of plastic wrap as the old ones get too tacky to release the balls easily once they are shaped. (If lots of clear, thickish liquid remains toward the end, dont try to use it all, or the filling will be too wet.) Set the balls of filling aside. Add the 1/4 cup oil, 3 tablespoons caramel sauce, and potassium bicarbonate solution to the sugar syrup. Use a rubber spatula to stir for about 1 minute, or until the mixture has increased in volume, is opaque, and is a rich caramel color. If necessary, add caramel sauce, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, to darken. Put the 2 3/4 cups flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the sugar syrup mixture into the well and use the spatula to stir until you have a soft dough with the texture of marzipan. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead in about 2 tablespoons flour to create a smooth, very malleable, slightly tacky dough. It may spread a bit when left to sit. Shape the dough into a log 2 inches in diameter. For 1/2-cup molds, cut the log at scant 1-inch intervals to yield 2-ounce pieces; for 2/3-cup molds, cut at 1-inch intervals to yield 2 1/2-ounce pieces. Weigh each piece for accuracy, pinching off or adding on dough as necessary. Save extra dough for emergency patching up. Cover the dough pieces loosely with plastic wrap and set aside. (The dough may be prepared 1 hour in advance of shaping the cakes.) Set up a station that allows you to whack the wooden mold firmly against a hard surface. Kitchen counters are not good. I typically put a piece of plywood and a section of a two-by-four on a dining room chair. Both pieces of wood should roughly span the width of the chair. The plywood does not have to match the depth of the chair. Position the wood pieces at the edge of the chair. The thin, wide plywood acts as a stabilizer, while the thicker two-by-four takes the pressure. (If you want to protect the floor, fold a towel or blanket to create a double or triple thickness and put it under the chairs feet.) When you are satisfied with the setup, take the mold by the handle and practice the whacking sequence outlined in step 17. Strike with confidence and strength to get a loud whack. If your arrangement seems sufficiently sturdy, continue to the next step. Set up a station for shaping the moon cakes near the whacking station, outfitting it with the following: a large work surface (such as a cutting board), flour for dusting, a small bowl of oil, a pastry brush, a rolling pin (preferably an Asian-style pin, which is essentially a 1-inch wood dowel), the dough pieces, the balls of filling, and the mold(s). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, oil the paper, and place them with the other tools. To shape each moon cake, first oil and flour the mold. Use a pastry brush dipped in oil to coat the carved surfaces lightly. Sprinkle in some flour and tap the mold against your hand to spread the flour evenly over the entire interior surface. Invert and tap the mold against the sink to remove excess flour. Set the prepared mold by your work area. Lightly flour the work surface and place a piece of dough on top of it. With a lightly floured hand, smack the dough to flatten it to a 1/4-inch-thick disk. Flip it over. Quickly dip 2 fingers into the oil and very lightly oil the rolling pin; this tiny bit of oil makes the dough easier to manipulate. With short, fast strokes, roll the dough away from its center, leaving a plump, roughly 1-inch-wide belly in the middle. With each roll, pick up the dough and give it a quarter turn to prevent sticking. When it is about 4 inches in diameter, stop turning the dough and make the final passes to create a circle 5 to 5 1/2 inches in diameter and a generous 1/8 inch thick at the edge. This Chinese method of rolling dough ensures an even thickness all around the cake. (If the dough sticks or breaks, scrape it up with a plastic dough scraper or knife, knead it back into a ball, and start over. It is a forgiving dough.) Pick up the dough circle and put it in one hand. Place a ball of filling in the center of the circle, and then invert the entire thing into the other hand; the dough will naturally droop over the filling. (The dough side that now faces you will be the pretty top of the cake.) Pass the ball back to the other hand so that the bottom of the cake now faces upward. Cupping the cake in one hand, use the fingers of your other hand to seal the dough, completely encasing the filling. Gently press, nudge, and mold the dough as needed. Once sealed, cup the ball in both hands and gently roll and pat it smooth. The pastry will take on a slight sheen. Place the ball, top side down, into the mold. Using the fleshy part of your hand between the base of your thumb and wrist, press the ball into the mold. Try to apply even pressure. Once the cake has filled the mold, go around the edge to press the pastry inward gently and away from the side walls of the mold. Th is helps the cake to release. To loosen the cake from the mold, step over to your whacking station. Take the handle of the mold and firmly whack it against the wood in this precise order: The first 4 whacks are applied to each side of the mold (left , top, right, and bottom). For the dramatic fifth and final whack, turn the mold so that the cake faces down and place your hand underneath to catch the cake as it falls out. Place the cake on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling, spacing the cakes about 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. As you work, take note of the following: If the cake threatens to jump out of the mold while you are whacking, immediately reduce the amount of pressure and continue through the entire sequence. If you have to set the ball of filling and dough down at any time, place it on a floured surface to prevent sticking. Because the carved impressions dull as oil and flour accumulate in the mold, occasionally pause between shaping the cakes to clean out the mold. (Use 2 molds and you will clean less often.) For cleaning, use a toothpick, skewer, or the tip of a paring knife to dislodge bits. A hard spray of water from the sink faucet also helps. After spraying, dry the mold with paper towels before oiling and flouring it for the next cake. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 250F. Meanwhile, make the glaze by combining the egg yolks and caramel sauce in a small bowl and mixing with a fork until well blended. Pass the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve into another small bowl. Discard the solids and set the bowl aside. Fill the spray bottle halfway with water and set aside. Use a toothpick to poke 3 or 4 air vents into the top of each cake, about 1/4 inch deep. (This helps the cakes bake more evenly.) Flat toothpicks make less conspicuous holes than round ones. Baking moon cakes is a three-step process, and you must bake only 1 sheet at a time. Loosely cover the unbaked cakes on 1 sheet with parchment paper. Slip the other sheet into the oven and bake for 22 to 25 minutes, or until the cakes look dull and a little puffed. Remove from the oven, and immediately spray the cakes with water to soften the dough. Wait for about 2 minutes, or until the water is absorbed, and then use your fingers to push and straighten up the cakes. (They are not that hot.) This cosmetic surgery helps to produce prettier cakes. Ideally, the sides should be straight, not flared. The cakes should retain most of their out-of-the-mold appearance but be slightly puffed. Once you are satisfied with how the cakes look, brush the tops with the glaze and return the cakes to the oven. Bake this second time for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the oven, brush again with the glaze, and return to the oven. Bake for a final 10 minutes, or until the tops are richly colored and shiny. Remove from the oven and put on a rack to cool. When the cakes are cool enough to handle, after about 30 minutes, you may straighten any lopsided, unsightly cakes. While the first baking sheet cools, bake the second sheet. As the moon cakes cool, they darken from the caramel sauce in the dough and glaze. When they are completely cool, store them in an airtight plastic container. Before eating them, allow them to age for 1 to 2 days to soften the pastry and develop the flavors. They will keep at room temperature for up to 5 days and in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Enjoy them at room temperature, cut into small wedges. To freeze, wrap each cake in plastic wrap and place the cakes on a baking sheet. Put the baking sheet in the freezer for several hours, or until the cakes are hard. Transfer the cakes to zip-top plastic bags and freeze for up to 6 months. To thaw, remove the plastic wrap from the still-frozen cakes, put the cakes in an airtight plastic container, and let stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 days before cutting and eating. Wooden moon cake molds are typically sold at Chinese and Vietnamese cookware stores, especially as the holiday nears. Or, check the Resources section (page 335) for an online vendor. Look for molds with holes pierced on the sides; they provide handy drainage and air vents. Moon cake molds hold either 1/2 cup or 2/3 cup and are sometimes marked 150 or 200 grams, respectively. If you are unsure, fill the mold with water to determine the size. For your first time making moon cakes, use the larger mold (about 2 3/4 inches in diameter and 1 1/4 inches deep), which is easier to work with. Molds from Vietnam are for making either baked moon cakes (this recipe) or for chewy unbaked cakes called banh deo (also eaten on this holiday). In general, molds for the former are carved with small, delicate scalloped edges, while molds for the latter have much bigger, robust edges. Although I have made this recipe with both kinds of molds, the cakes are prettiest when made with the proper mold. Here are some tips for locating ingredients: Citric acid, sold in crystallized form as sour salt (also called citric salt), is usually stocked in the kosher-food section of mainstream supermarkets. Potassium bicarbonate solution (lye water) is sold at Chinese markets in glass bottles shelved near the vinegars. Sorghum and rose petal liquor (mei kwei lu chiu) is available at Chinese markets, too. Look for the Chinese name on the bottles or boxes. It is also great for sipping. Health-food stores with a bulk section are great places to buy small quantities of nuts. Candied citron and fruitcake mix are seasonal ingredients that may be stored for several years. Buy a small supply in November, when they are sold for holiday baking. See page 169 for tips on finding pork fatback.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Mikes NY Cheesecake 101. Ingredients: 30 Graham Crackers (crushed for crust), 4 tbsp Sugar (for crust), 4 tbsp Melted Salted Butter (for crust), 4 packages Philadelphia Cream Cheese, 1 tbsp Vanilla Extract, 1 cup High Fat Sour Cream, 1/4 cup All Purpose Flour, 3/4 cup Whole Milk, 1 1/2 cup Sugar, 4 Fresh Eggs, 1 Garnish Of Your Choosing, 1 Spring Form Pan (with a smooth base-no texture), 3 18\\"" x 18\\"" Sheets Tinfoil (nothing smaller or you will end up with a soggy cake), 1 can Pam Butter Spray, 1 Set Measuring Spoons, 1 Set Measuring Cups, 1 large Mixing Bowl, 1 Plastic Spatula, 1 Electric Beater, Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 (175 degrees C). Triple wrap the outside of your spring form pan tightly with tinfoil. Make certain there are no holes or tears in the foil that water can seep through. Spray Pam a 9 inch spring form pan. In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crust crumbs with melted butter. Reserve a small amount of your crust after mixing. Press on to bottom of spring form pan and halfway up the sides. Note: I use a few stiff paper plates that are stuck together and press down firmly with that. This will make a thicker, more sturdy crust than the average. If using boxed, crushed Graham Crackers, double the amount the recipe calls for one pie crust. Bake crust in oven at 350 for 8 to 9 minutes on the bottom 1/3 rack of your oven. After baking, fill in any cracks with additional graham cracker crust. Press firmly but gently again. Let crust cool quickly in fridge or freezer. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese just until smooth. Blend in milk and sugar in cream cheese until just blended. Then mix in the eggs, one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour just until smooth. Pour filling into cooled, prepared crust and flatten with plastic spatula or spoon. Place your spring form pan in a roasting pan and fill it with boiling water until its half way up your spring form pan. Place cake and roasting pan on the same 1/3 rack you baked your crust on. Put cake in oven immediately and bake in preheated 350 oven undisturbed for 1 hour. Turn the oven off and allow the cake to cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours absolutely undisturbed. Do not open the oven door. The trapped moisture should prevent any cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving. Serve Cheesecake at room temperature. One hour prior to serving, place chilled fruit garnishments on your cake or you can serve it plain. FORTY CHEESECAKE TIPS! *Listed below are 40 tips to help ensure your cheesecakes arent dry, dont over brown at the edges, dont crack or have the crust fall apart. There are also tips on batter mixtures, cooking times, falling cakes, garnish options and so on. In short, almost everything youll need to know to make the perfect cheesecake every time. Just note that no advice will absolutely guarantee that your cake will not crack or split, however, if you follow these basic tips, youll have a better chance than most. TIPS FOR CHEESECAKE CRUSTS: #1 Always pre-bake your crust for 8-10 minutes. Regardless if the recipe doesnt necessarily call for it. #2 Preheat your oven to 350. Make your graham cracker crust and press it into the base of your spring form pan firmly and just slightly up the sides. Withhold a small amount of crust mixture and set to the side covered. After youve laid your crust in your spring form pan, place it on the bottom 1/3 rack of your oven and bake 8-10 minutes. #3 Your crust will probably call for butter. Consider using a quality salted butter like Tillamook to negate some of that sweetness if using a candy topper or overly sweet garnish. #4 After baking, press crust again until its even. Use the remaining graham cracker mixture to fill in cracks if any. I use a paper plate to press the crust evenly. Let crust cool quickly in fridge or freezer. #5 Have every ingredient at room temperature, even the sugar. This will help tremendously with your mixing and blending. #6 Using cold cream cheese in your mixture will cause lumps. However, if you do find yourself with lumps anyway, run mixture through a sieve (tight strainer) and squeeze through with spatula. Or you can spin mixture very quickly in a food processor. #7 Dont use cream cheese in a tub or bucket of any kind. Whipped cream cheese has far too much air in it to make a sturdy or functional cheesecake. #8 Use quality cream cheese bricks that are high in fat. The same with your sour cream-high fat. These will make the best cheesecakes. Its not exactly the healthiest option but hey, whats life without a little whimsy? #9 When mixing your cheesecake ingredients, be careful not to over beat them. Youll want your mixture smooth yes, but my best advice is, \\""Dont be confused by anyone else. Do exactly as the author of the recipe advises you to do since theyve not only experimented with the recipe but obviously made the same recipe many, many times before.\\ Just remember though, less mixing is better for the cake. #10 Try this if youre worried about over mixing: Beat your softened, room temperature cream cheese first, then add all of your additional ingredients one at a time. (or as your author recommends) You wont have to blend as much and risk over beating. #11 Another way of softening your cream cheese is place your brick in the microwave for 15 seconds. 15 additional seconds for every brick you have in the microwave alongside another. #12 Also, you can add 3 1/2 tbs AP flour to your batter if your recipe doesnt already call for it. All purpose flour helps keep your cake from splitting and the flour doesn?t tamper with the taste whatsoever. However, it does effect the texture but not enough to make a huge difference. The benefits of adding a starch include: Your cake isnt as apt to rise in the middle during baking and eventually sink in the center. Your cakes top will be flatter and smoother than without it. Flour will also almost eliminate that dry, dark brown and raised/hardened edge cheesecakes are synonymous for. #13 It is important to note that cheesecake recipes that contain even a small amount of starch, i.e., cornstarch or flour, will produce a more cake-like texture. Cheesecakes that do not contain starch tend to be more smooth, creamy and heavy so choose your recipe wisely if you do have a preference! #14 Time wise, cook your cheesecake as per your authors directions BUT leave your cake in the oven after the baking is completed for a minimum of 2 hours. I know some say 1 hour, some say 6 hours and some say 5 minutes. However, Ive always had the best of luck with leaving it at minimum (if hurried) of 2 hours undisturbed with the oven door closed and a maximum of 6 hours. In my opinion, even if your recipe doent call for this step and you have the extra time, do it anyway. #15 No poking, no shaking and no toothpicks if checking for doneness during or after baking. In fact, dont check for doneness at all. Find a solid recipe with high ratings and trust it. #16 Speaking of your cake shaking, your cheesecake will shake a bit at its completion but by leaving it in the oven and the cakes refrigerator sitting time, I promise your cake will firm up! #17 When you cake is setting up, do not peak at the cake (even while baking) and do not open the oven door under any circumstances. Heres why. This will let the moisture escape from the hot water bath within the oven and will cause cake cracking and potentially dry your out your cheesecake. The point of the hot water bath is moisture, moisture, moisture! #18 If you find you do have some minor cracking on top, a simple cream cheese frosting will cover those right up and put a silky sheen atop your cheesecake. A garnish (fruit or otherwise) will do the same so no worries! TIPS FOR BAKING CHEESECAKES: #20 Preheat oven as per the authors directions for your specific cheesecake recipe. Take (3) 18\\"" x 18\\"" pieces of heavy duty tin foil and CAREFULLY wrap one sheet around the outside of your spring form pan, barely crimping the foil neatly and tightly over the top of pan. Be careful as to not make any holes in the tinfoil whatsoever. If you do, discard that foil and start over with a new sheet. Do the same thing again and again with the second and third sheet of tinfoil. Remember folks, no holes. This will keep the fluid from the hot water bath (listed below) from seeping through to your cheesecake. #21 Some professional Bakers have reported that using extra large Turkey Baking Bags work pretty good as well for keeping water out. However, I would still use them in conjunction with tinfoil for precautions sake. Mishaps occur all the time with hot water baths. #22 After wrapping your spring form pan that already contains your baked crust, fill your pan with your cheesecake mixture and level it neatly with a plastic spatula or spoon. #23 Dont tamp your unbaked cheesecake mixture on the counter after pouring and leveling it if you see air pockets. Youll shatter your crust and it will fall apart upon serving. #24 Place your spring form pan inside a deep roasting pan in the same bottom 1/3 rack as you baked your crust upon. Now, fill your roasting pan with piping hot water from a tea kettle until its risen halfway up your cheesecake pan. Usually it takes about 1 1/4\\"" of water. Be careful not to burn yourself reaching in the oven while filing your pan. This method is slightly safer than filling the roaster outside of the oven and setting your cake in boiling water. All the while hoping you didnt rip the foil as you try to balance everything without scalding yourself just sounds a bit more dangerous to me. #25 Another option: Instead of placing your spring form pan inside a roasting pan is to place an oven safe pan filed with rapid boiling water to the side of your cake pan in the oven. Its not as effective but it does work! Moisture is moisture! #26 When you finally pull the cheesecake out, place it in the fridge and chill for at least 4 hours but longer is better for your cake. #27 When youre cheesecake is ready to be unhinged, a good tip is to use a hairdryer to heat up the spring form sides and use a clean, thin, warm butter knife to separate the cake from the pan walls then unhinge pan. Some Bakers even use the knife method just as the cake is done and then quickly put the cake back in the oven to let it sit for a few hours. #28 After a long chill time and unhinging your spring pan, use two large spatulas to pick up your cake and move it safely to a serving platter. #29 If your recipe calls for you to take your cake directly out of the oven and plate asap, its a good idea to lightly butter the outside edges while the cake is still warm. #30 If you intend on freezing your cake, double wrap your firm, 4 to 5 hour refrigerated cheesecake air tight with plastic wrap and tinfoil. But before you wrap it, freeze the cake uncovered for at least 30 minutes so it can firm up enough to handle the double wrap without denting or mis-shaping it. #31 A frozen cheesecake can last up to 2 months in the freezer but 1 month is typically recommended. To de-thaw your cake, just place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. #32 Cheesecake should always be served at room temperature so take it out of the fridge 45 minutes early unless the weather is very warm. 25-30 minutes will take it to room temperature. #33 Always garnish your cheesecake 1 hour before serving. Have your canned or fresh fruit in the fridge so its fully chilled when youre ready to top and serve. Remember, the cheesecake should be at room temperature but a chilled fruit garnish is always desired and appreciated! #34 Theres no need to purchase expensive fruit cheesecake toppers. In fact, one of the best cheesecakes I ever tasted was made with seven tablespoons of warmed, quality, multi-berry jam swirled within the cake and baked! #35 Most seem to think that a cheesecake MUST have a topping or theme of some type. However, have youve ever noticed that plain cheesecakes are usually the first to run out at a party or reunion? My theory? Its probably because the most of us are simply fickle by nature. Some like cherry but prefer strawberry. Some adore blueberry but dont want to stain their teeth in public. Some enjoy pineapple but claim it gives them canker sores so they decline. Some even gag at the smell of pumpkin. With that, (other than the lactose intolerant or extreme dieters) most end up choosing the pain ole moist, delicious piece of cheesecake rather than going without. So dont fear the void folks! #36 Cheesecake is a lot like Sushi. In order to get a brilliantly clean cut, fill a bowl with steaming hot water and dip your knife in it until its heated. Have a clean towel handy to clean your knife blade in between each slice. Viola! Youll have perfect slices every time! #37 Never use anything other than quality cream cheeses in your cheesecakes. Even if there is a sale on generic cream cheese touting 500 bricks for $2.00. While you can purchase the more expensive cheeses at a deli, the best cream cheese out there for the price is Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese. #38 Always make sure you look for any special instructions (i.e., high or low altitude or barometer precautions) in your recipe. #39 As I understand it, some of the most famous cheesecakes baked at 3 to 5 star restaurants worldwide employ the low and slow methods of baking their cheesecakes. They start out at 350 then reduce to 275 and bake for 1 1/2 hours. After baking, they leave their cheesecakes in the oven and dont open the oven door for at least 4 hours. They also employ the hot water bath technique. So, if you come across any recipe that mimics anything like theirs, give her a try! #40 Kids love to help decorate and if youre interested in getting them to eat cheesecake, try putting whipped cream on top of your cake and have them decorate with candies such as: Skittles M&Ms Mini Marshmallows Mini chocolate chips Mini Tootsie Rolls Fruit Rollups Banana Runts Malted Milk Balls Gummy Bears Or Worms Starburst Candies Twizzlers Life Savers Crushed Peppermint Crushed Peanut Brittle Marzipan Shapes Chocolate shapes & Curls Chocolate Mints Hersheys Kisses *Cheesecake has got to be one of the most versatile desserts in the entire universe. From fresh fruits to canned fruits, to chocolates and candies, it can accommodate most anything the most creative imagination can dream up. Is also healthy for you. Especially if youre a Diabetic with a sweet tooth! I personally have a Vampire Cheesecake recipe thats packed with 40 cloves of garlic as well as one thats topped with Foie gras moouse and Beluga Caviar in my culinary repertoire! Now, Im not suggesting you try those. Just know that there are far more garnish options than Cherry or Blueberry! Face it, the garnish options are as endless as they are delicious! Follow these tips for as perfect of a cheesecake as youre ever going to make! Let me know your favorite cheesecake recipes and toppings! Maybe you even have tips of your own youd like to share with the world! Id love to hear all of them!","```cypher
