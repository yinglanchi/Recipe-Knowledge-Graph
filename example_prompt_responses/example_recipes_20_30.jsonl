Ingredients: 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 onion, chopped, 2 (12 ounce) cans fat-free evaporated milk, 2 teaspoons dried basil, 12 teaspoon nutmeg, 12 teaspoon black pepper, 1 lb frozen broccoli florets, 1 lb whole wheat pasta, linguine or 1 lb fettuccine, 1 cup grated asiago cheese, 1 lb boneless skinless chicken tenders, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too), 1 lb cooked peeled shrimp, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too), 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 12 ounces sliced mushrooms, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 garlic clove, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too), asiago cheese, grated, red pepper flakes, sliced green onion, Instructions: I find it best if preparing in this order: Cook chicken and pasta at the same time. Cook mushrooms and sauce at the same time, finish by preparing the shrimp. Prepare chicken in a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and garlic. Over medium-high, heat until oil & garlic sizzle. Be careful not burn garlic or it may taste bitter. Add chicken tenders and saute on both sides until browned and firm, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove chicken; keep warm until ready to serve. Prepare linguini or fettuccine according to package directions. After thorough draining, return to original cooking pot, and cover to keep warm. Prepare the sauce in a large non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until softened. Add the milk, basil, nutmeg, pepper, and broccoli. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook on low. Check after 3 minutes to see if broccoli is tender. You may need to simmer for an additional 2 minutes- take care when regulating heat to prevent scalding the milk. Prepare mushrooms in the same skillet used to cook chicken. Over medium-high, heat until oil & garlic sizzle. Add mushrooms and saute, tossing frequently until tender and lightly browned. Remove from heat and keep warm until ready to serve. Prepare the shrimp, while the sauce and mushrooms are cooking, in a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and garlic. Over medium-high, heat until oil & garlic sizzle. Quickly add shrimp and saute for 2 minute (shrimp is already cooked; you are only heating it through). Remove from heat and sprinkle evenly with lemon juice. Top pasta, by alternating sauce and cheese, while tossing to coat. You may arrange the chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms in warmed bowls, allowing your guests to choose their favorite; or incorporate all ingredients together. Sprinkle with additional grated Asiago cheese. Sliced green onion is a nice garnish; a nice flavor medley when paired with this sauce. For the daring, dust this dish with red pepper flakes (hint: test first because a little goes along way)."}], "temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.5}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8yCUyxcRdB85tcOP4ZlS5NBcCDyaZ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709358416, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```cypher\n// Ingredients\nCREATE (oliveOil:Ingredient {name: \"olive oil\", referenceText: \"1 teaspoon olive oil\"})\nCREATE (onion:Ingredient {name: \"onion\", referenceText: \"1 onion, chopped\"})\nCREATE (milk:Ingredient {name: \"fat-free evaporated milk\", referenceText: \"2 (12 ounce) cans fat-free evaporated milk\"})\nCREATE (basil:Ingredient {name: \"dried basil\", referenceText: \"2 teaspoons dried basil\"})\nCREATE (nutmeg:Ingredient {name: \"nutmeg\", referenceText: \"1/2 teaspoon nutmeg\"})\nCREATE (blackPepper:Ingredient {name: \"black pepper\", referenceText: \"1/2 teaspoon black pepper\"})\nCREATE (broccoli:Ingredient {name: \"frozen broccoli florets\", referenceText: \"1 lb frozen broccoli florets\"})\nCREATE (pasta:Ingredient {name: \"whole wheat pasta\", referenceText: \"1 lb whole wheat pasta, linguine or 1 lb fettuccine\"})\nCREATE (asiagoCheese:Ingredient {name: \"asiago cheese\", referenceText: \"1 cup grated asiago cheese\"})\nCREATE (chicken:Ingredient {name: \"boneless skinless chicken tenders\", referenceText: \"1 lb boneless skinless chicken tenders\"})\nCREATE (garlic:Ingredient {name: \"garlic cloves\", referenceText: \"3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too)\"})\nCREATE (shrimp:Ingredient {name: \"cooked peeled shrimp\", referenceText: \"1 lb cooked peeled shrimp\"})\nCREATE (lemonJuice:Ingredient {name: \"lemon juice\", referenceText: \"1 tablespoon lemon juice\"})\nCREATE (mushrooms:Ingredient {name: \"sliced mushrooms\", referenceText: \"12 ounces sliced mushrooms\"})\nCREATE (redPepperFlakes:Ingredient {name: \"red pepper flakes\", referenceText: \"red pepper flakes\"})\nCREATE (greenOnion:Ingredient {name: \"sliced green onion\", referenceText: \"sliced green onion\"})\n\n// Tools\nCREATE (skillet:Tool {name: \"skillet\", referenceText: \"large non-stick skillet\"})\nCREATE (pot:Tool {name: \"pot\", referenceText: \"original cooking pot\"})\n\n// Processes\nCREATE (cookChicken:Process {name: \"Cook Chicken\", referenceText: \"Prepare chicken in a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and garlic.\"})\nCREATE (cookPasta:Process {name: \"Cook Pasta\", referenceText: \"Prepare linguini or fettuccine according to package directions.\"})\nCREATE (prepareSauce:Process {name: \"Prepare Sauce\", referenceText: \"Prepare the sauce in a large non-stick skillet.\"})\nCREATE (cookMushrooms:Process {name: \"Cook Mushrooms\", referenceText: \"Prepare mushrooms in the same skillet used to cook chicken.\"})\nCREATE (prepareShrimp:Process {name: \"Prepare Shrimp\", referenceText: \"Prepare the shrimp, while the sauce and mushrooms are cooking, in a large non-stick skillet.\"})\nCREATE (assembleDish:Process {name: \"Assemble Dish\", referenceText: \"Top pasta, by alternating sauce and cheese, while tossing to coat.\"})\n\n// Sub-recipe: Chicken\nCREATE (chickenRecipe:Process {name: \"Chicken Recipe\", referenceText: \"Prepare chicken in a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and garlic.\"})\nCREATE (endChickenRecipe:Process {name: \"Chicken\", referenceText: \"Remove chicken;

Add the powdered sugar to Step 2, and mix until it turns white. (Its ok if its roughly mixed together.) Once mixed together, add the egg, and mix further. The mixture may separate to start with, but it will blend together as you keep mixing. Add the dry ingredients into Step 4, and fold in gently using a rubber spatula. To make white dough and brown dough, divide the dough into 90% and 10%. Add the cocoa to the bigger batch. Take out 10% of the cocoa dough and add more cocoa to make dark brown dough. (For eyes and nose.) Wrap the dough with cling film and let it rest for more than 30 minutes in the fridge. Start preheating the oven to 180C before you start shaping the teddy bears. Take out the dough from the fridge, and shape it into teddy bears face as you like. The photo shows the parts I made for my teddy bear cookies. Bake at 180C for 10-12 minutes. The cooking time differs depending on your oven, so adjust accordingly. Once they are baked, place on a cooling rack, and cool them a little. Then theyre done! If you have leftover white dough, why not make koalas or pandas with it? I made other kinds of animals as well. The bunny was the easiest."}], "temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.5}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8yCUy4vWh21PjqFnFb1HaaedXnI0m", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709358416, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```cypher\n// Ingredients\nCREATE (riceFlour:Ingredient {name: \"Rice flour\", quantity: \"150 grams\", referenceText: \"150 grams Rice flour (Joshinko)\"})\nCREATE (almondFlour:Ingredient {name: \"Almond flour\", quantity: \"50 grams\", referenceText: \"50 grams Almond flour\"})\nCREATE (butter:Ingredient {name: \"Butter\", quantity: \"100 grams\", type: \"unsalted\", referenceText: \"100 grams Butter (unsalted)\"})\nCREATE (powderedSugar:Ingredient {name: \"Powdered sugar\", quantity: \"60 grams\", referenceText: \"60 grams Powdered sugar (or caster sugar)\"})\nCREATE (cocoa:Ingredient {name: \"Cocoa\", quantity: \"5 grams or more\", type: \"unsweetened\", referenceText: \"5 grams or more Cocoa (unsweetened)\"})\nCREATE (egg:Ingredient {name: \"Egg\", quantity: \"1 large\", referenceText: \"1 large egg\"})\nCREATE (bakingPowder:Ingredient {name: \"Baking powder\", quantity: \"1 tsp\", referenceText: \"1 tsp Baking powder\"})\nCREATE (bakingSoda:Ingredient {name: \"Baking soda\", quantity: \"1/2 tsp\", referenceText: \"1/2 tsp Baking soda\"})\nCREATE (vanillaEssence:Ingredient {name: \"Vanilla essence\", quantity: \"1\", referenceText: \"1 Vanilla essence\"})\n\n// Tools\nCREATE (whisk:Tool {name: \"Whisk\", referenceText: \"cream it with a whisk\"})\nCREATE (bowl:Tool {name: \"Bowl\", referenceText: \"Put the butter in a bowl\"})\nCREATE (microwave:Tool {name: \"Microwave\", referenceText: \"If the butter is too hard, microwave for about 15 seconds\"})\nCREATE (rubberSpatula:Tool {name: \"Rubber spatula\", referenceText: \"fold in gently using a rubber spatula\"})\nCREATE (clingFilm:Tool {name: \"Cling film\", referenceText: \"Wrap the dough with cling film\"})\nCREATE (oven:Tool {name: \"Oven\", temperature: \"180C\", referenceText: \"Start preheating the oven to 180C\"})\n\n// Actions\nCREATE (siftDryIngredients:Action {name: \"Sift the dry ingredients\", referenceText: \"Sift the dry ingredients (or you can omit this)\"})\nCREATE (beatEgg:Action {name: \"Beat the egg\", referenceText: \"Beat the egg\"})\nCREATE (creamButter:Action {name: \"Cream the butter\", referenceText: \"cream it with a whisk\"})\nCREATE (mixPowderedSugar:Action {name: \"Mix powdered sugar\", referenceText: \"Add the powdered sugar to Step 2, and mix until it turns white\"})\nCREATE (mixEgg:Action {name: \"Mix the egg\", referenceText: \"Once mixed together, add the egg, and mix further\"})\nCREATE (foldInDryIngredients:Action {name: \"Fold in dry ingredients\", referenceText: \"Add the dry ingredients into Step 4, and fold in gently using a rubber spatula\"})\nCREATE (divideDough:Action {name: \"Divide the dough\", referenceText: \"To make white dough and brown dough, divide the dough into 90% and 10%\"})\nCREATE (addCocoa:Action {name: \"Add cocoa\", referenceText: \"Add the cocoa to the bigger batch\"})\nCREATE (restDough:Action {name: \"Rest the dough\", referenceText: \"Wrap the dough with cling film and let it rest for more than 30 minutes in the fridge\"})\nCREATE (shapeDough:Action {name: \"Shape the dough\", referenceText: \"Take out the dough from the fridge, and shape it into teddy bears face as you like\"})\nCREATE (preheatOven:Action {name: \"Preheat the oven\", referenceText: \"Start preheating the oven to 180C before you start shaping the teddy bears\"})\nCREATE (bakeCookies:Action {name: \"Bake the cookies\", temperature: \"180C\", time: \"10-12 minutes\", referenceText: \"Bake at 180C for 10-12 minutes\"})\nCREATE (coolCookies:Action {name: \"Cool the cookies\", referenceText: \"Once they are baked, place on a cooling rack, and cool them a little\"})\n\n// Sub-Recipe: Make Dark Brown Dough\nCREATE (makeDarkBrownDough:Action {name: \"Make Dark Brown Dough\", referenceText: \"Take out 10% of the cocoa dough and add more cocoa to make dark brown dough.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "A recipe is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with heterogeneous nodes and edges provides a structured and semantically rich way to represent the information. In this context, the nodes represent entities such as ingredients, utensils, or tools, actions (e.g., chop, boil), and possibly conditions (e.g., for 5 minutes, until golden brown), and final product. The edges represent relationships or dependencies between these entities. The graph must represent intermediate states (like a output of mixing spices), optional steps, and recipe variants. The graph should model XORs (e.g., either use dry chilies or green chilies but not both, either bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes or broil on high for 20 minutes). It should capture 1) measures e.g., one cup of milk, temperature at 400 deg. F, bake for 20 minutes etc., and 2) conditions like \"fry until light brown\" or \"check for uniform consistency\". The graph needs to represent sub-recipes (like preparing a gravy) as a hierarchical subgraph. We need a separate set of FOLLOWED_BY edges between successive process nodes. Also for every process, we need a set of incoming PREREQ (for prerequisite) edges to connect ingredients to processes. We also need USES edges between process nodes and tool nodes. Further, for each node, add an attribute called \"referenceText\" where you identify the phrase from the original text that relates to the node or the edge of the graph. Produce the result using Cypher CREATE, MERGE and SET statements. Do not invent any ingredients, tools, or utensil nodes. Ensure the graph is connected. Also ensure each sub-recipe is a small recipe graph whose end node is the name of the sub-recipes. The sub-recipe end nodes must be connected to the main recipe.

Ingredients: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 24 medium Gulf shrimp, shell removed and deveined, 1 poblano pepper, quartered and thinly sliced, 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped, 4 cups shrimp stock, recipe follows, 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, Salt and freshly ground pepper, 1/2 cup chopped peanuts, Dirty Rice, recipe follows, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 3 cups shells and tails from raw shrimp, 1 large onion, coarsely chopped, 1 small carrot, coarsely chopped, 1/2 medium celery stalk, coarsely chopped, 6 cups water, 1 cup white wine, 1 ripe medium tomato, chopped or 1/2 cup canned plum tomatoes, 1 bay leaf, 2 tablespoons olive oil, Salt and freshly ground pepper, 1 pound chicken livers, 1 large red onion, finely diced, 1 yellow pepper, finely diced, 1 red pepper finely diced, 1 stalk celery, finely diced, 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped, 1 serrano chile, finely diced, 2 cups long grain rice, 4 1/2 cups home-made chicken stock or low sodium canned stock, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat leaf parsley, 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme, Instructions: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the shrimp and sear on both sides until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Remove the shrimp to a plate. Add the poblano pepper to pan and cook until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the shrimp stock, bring to a boil, and reduce by half. Add the shrimp back to the pan, stir in the butter, lime juice, and cilantro, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon over Dirty Rice onk a platter and sprinkle with the peanuts. In a large saucepan over high heat, heat the oil until almost smoking and saute the shrimp shells and tails, onion, carrot and celery for 5 minutes, stirring. Add the water, wine, tomato, and bay leaf. Reduce the heat to medium, partially cover and simmer for 40 minutes. Strain through cheesecloth or a fine strainer. Yield: 4 to 5 cups Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Add the chicken livers to the pan and sear on both sides until golden brown (do not cook through, they will continue cooking in the rice). Remove the livers with a slotted spoon to a cutting board, let cool slightly and coarsely chop. Add the onions, peppers, celery, garlic, and serrano chile to the pan and cook until golden brown. Stir in the rice and cook for 2 minutes. Add the stock, maple syrup, chicken livers and season with salt and pepper, stir well and bring to a boil. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and continue cooking for 12 to15 minutes.
