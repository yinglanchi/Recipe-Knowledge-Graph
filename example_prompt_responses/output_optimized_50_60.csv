"Recipe Name: Theyll Love Your Buns...For Hamburgers & Hot Dogs. Ingredients: 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, 1 cup lukewarm milk, 3/4 cup warm water, 3 tablespoons solid vegetable shortening, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, plus a pinch, 1 extra-large egg, at room temperature, 1 extra-large egg yolk, at room temperature, 1 package active dry yeast, Up to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour, sifted, Medium-ground cornmeal, 1 egg white beaten with 1 teaspoon water (optional), Sesame seeds, Poppy seeds, Caraway seeds, and/or, Toasted dehydrated onions reconstituted in a little hot water, Kosher or sea salt to taste, Instructions: Use some of the melted butter to grease the interior of a 5- or 6-quart mixing bowl. Set that bowl aside. Pour the warm milk into a mixing bowl and add 1/2 cup of the warm water, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, the shortening, salt, 2 tablespoons of sugar, the egg, and the yolk. Mix well. Dissolve the yeast in the remaining 1/4 cup warm water with the pinch of sugar and allow it to become visibly active, about 3 minutes. Add the dissolved yeast mixture to the mixing bowl and stir in enough flour, cup by cup, to create a somewhat stiff, shaggy mass thats no longer easily stirred. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the mass onto a floured surface, and knead it until youve created a dough thats smooth and elastic, adding only as much additional flour as is needed to keep the dough from sticking. Place the dough in the greased bowl and brush the top with more melted butter. Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm draft-free spot for 2 hours. Uncover the dough and punch it down with several swift swats with the back of your hand. Turn the dough over in the bowl and knead it gently to redistribute the yeast. Recover the bowl and let the dough rise again until light and billowy, about 1 hour. Line two shallow baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle the paper with cornmeal. If using one oven to accommodate both baking sheets at one time, place the racks in the upper-and lower-third shelf positions. If using a double oven, have the racks on the center shelves. Preheat the oven to 375F. If planning to apply a topping to the buns, make your egg white glaze and strain it into another bowl so its easier to apply. Place your seeds and/or reconstituted onions in small bowls, if using. After the second rise, uncover the dough and punch it down to deflate it. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly and gently. To shape burger buns, use your pastry scraper to divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and cover them while working with one piece at time. Shape each piece into an irregular round, then pull up the sides, repeatedly, pinching the gathered ends on top to form a small knot. Continue pulling and pinching until the dough is round and taut with a slightly pinched area on top, flouring your fingertips as necessary. Turn the ball of dough on its side and drive the blade of your pastry scraper down through the waist of the round (not through the pinched end), cutting the ball in half. Lay both halves cut side up, gently opening them so they lie flat. Sandwich both cut sides together, then pinch the cut edges together, sealing them shut. Place the squatty round down smoothest side up, and flatten it quite firmly, using your fingers to shove the pinched seam gently under the bun all the way around. When a bit flatter than you think appropriate, lay the bun (smoothest side up) on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a clean kitchen towel while you shape the rest. Let the buns rise for 20 minutes, starting after the last bun has been shaped. To shape hot dog buns, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and cover them while working with one piece at a time. For each bun, roll a piece of dough into an 8-inch strand and flatten the strand using either a straight rolling pin or the heel of your hand. Roll both long sides of the dough in toward the center, and when the two sides meet in the middle, pinch them together to seal shut. Working with one end at a time, lift the dough at one short end and fold it over, rounding off that end and attaching that portion of dough to the seam, going about 2 inches down the length of the seam. Do this on the opposite end and pinch the dough, as needed, to correct the shape. When done, the seam should be straight and the bun about 7 inches long. Place the baking sheet horizontally in front of you. Invert the bun onto the prepared baking sheet, seam side down, close to one end of the sheet. Repeat the shaping procedure with the remaining dough, placing them in a vertical line, only 1/2 inch apart. (They should merge in the oven.) Tear off two large sheets of aluminum foil and scrunch each one into the shape of the buns. Spray them with vegetable spray and tuck these foil buns at either end of the lineup of buns, giving these last buns boundaries. If not applying a topping, cover the buns with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for 20 minutes, starting after the last bun has been shaped. If topping hamburger or hot dog buns, as soon as youve finished shaping them, brush the tops of the unrisen buns with the egg white glaze and sprinkle the tops with seeds or the reconstituted dried onions. Cover the buns with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for 20 minutes. If the remaining melted butter has congealed, rewarm it just until liquefied. Uncover the risen buns and brush the tops with melted butter (brush gently over the topping). Regardless of their shape, bake the buns in the preheated 375F. oven until they are golden and feel light, 25 to 30 minutes. If baking in the upper and lower shelves of the oven, switch the position of the baking sheets after half the baking time. Also, check the burger buns after half the baking and, if becoming too pointy in the center, use a flat metal turning spatula to gently push this raised section down a bit, taking care not to split the sides of the bun. When done, remove the buns from the oven and brush them once more with melted butter. Transfer the buns to wire racks so they can cool until just warm. Just before serving, separate the hot dog buns by pulling them off of each other. Serve the hot dogs and burgers with your favorite mustard and relish and a bowl of spicy ketchup, all passed at the table.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Baked Barbecued Pork Buns (Cha Sui Bao). Ingredients: 1 tablespoon ginger grated, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, dark, 2 tablespoons sugar, 3/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon peanut oil, 1 cup onions finely chopped, 3 cups pork cantonese barbecue, cut in 1/2-inch dice, about 1 pound, 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 2 each egg yolks, 2 tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 package yeast, active dry (1 tablespoon), 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 cup milk warm, 1 each eggs, 3/4 cup vegetable oil, 3 1/2 cups flour, all-purpose + more for dusting and kneading, Instructions: Reheat in a 350F (180C). oven for 5 minutes, or microwave at high about 1 minute. Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and water in a bowl. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion; stir-fry until soft. Dont brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds. Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15 seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10 pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each circle 18 inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker. If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it. Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb. Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Beat egg yolks with water and sugar; brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes. Makes 20 buns. CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked to the Western eye. Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4 cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk. Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a lightly floured board. Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves. Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Cilantro Garlic Tilapia & Spiced Zucchini. Ingredients: 2 Tablespoons Coconut Oil, 4 ounces, weight Tilapia Fillets (4), 6 cloves Garlic, 2 teaspoons Sea Salt, 1/4 cups Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice, 1/4 cups Fresh Chopped Cilantro, 1/2 teaspoons Ground Black Pepper, 1/4 teaspoons Red Pepper Flakes, 1/4 teaspoons Cumin, 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil, 4 whole Zucchini, 1/4 teaspoons Coriander, Instructions: Tilapia Instructions: 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 2. Use a little coconut oil to grease the bottom of a baking pan, then lay the Tilapia fillets out nice and pretty. 3. Sprinkle a few dashes of sea salt on the Tilapia. This is not specified in the ingredients list, but its pretty necessary. 4. Mince the garlic cloves and transfer to a bowl. My husband and I are a garlic loving clan. Kind of a go big or go home situation. Feel free to cut back to 4 even only 2 cloves of garlic. You know, if youre into kissing or anything like that. 5. Add to the bowl of garlic: 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 cup lemon juice (if you can, use real lemons and squeeze them trust me), 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, and 1/4 tsp. each of ground black pepper, red pepper flakes, and cumin. 5. Mix until all ingredients are well-acquainted. 6. Spoon mixture over the Tilapia fillets. Be sure to dump any extra juices over the whole business as well we dont waste here. 7. Pop the fish in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Tilapia is fast, fresh, and easy. (At least, thats her reputation. Har har har.) While the Tilapia is cooking... Zucchini Instructions (Yes, both of my first recipes on here include zucchini. No Im not embarrassed. Not that much. What? I like zucchini.) 1. Melt 1 Tbsp. coconut oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat. 2. Slice up the zucchini. If youre feeling fancy, do it diagonally. (I could not be bothered with fanciness tonight when I made the meal shown in the picture above.) 3. Place zucchini in pan with melted coconut oil, add 1 tsp. sea salt, 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper and 1/4 tsp. coriander. 4. Do some stirring. 5. Cook the zucchini until just slightly transparent. Dont let it get mushy, because heaven knows nobody likes mushy zucchini. However, if one or two pieces get a little mushy in the sauteing process (like that top one in my photo), dont stress out. No one will judge you. Serve these two dishes together the flavors compliment each other really well. Or serve separately. Experiment its the best part of cooking!","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Chocolate Purses with Rhubarb-Raspberry Mousse. Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups rhubarb fresh or frozen, about 1/2 lb. finely diced, 13 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon gelatin, unflavored unflavored, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup raspberries fresh, 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream well chilled, 2 cups raspberries fresh, 5 tablespoons powdered sugar, 7 ounces chocolate (semi-sweet) semi-sweet, grated, 2 ounces chocolate unsweetened unsweetened, grated, 1/4 cup corn syrup, light, 1 1/2 teaspoons rum or cognac, 1 x powdered sugar for kneading and rolling, Instructions: Place a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of your electric mixer in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. MAKE THE MOUSSE: Combine the rhubarb and sugar in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the rhubarb is very soft. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and puree. Transfer the puree to a medium nonreactive mixing bowl and set aside. Put 2 tablespoons cold water in a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over. Set aside and let soften for 5 minutes. Heat the mixture over low heat, swirling until the gelatin is completely dissolved and no grains remain. Stir the gelatin into the pureed rhubarb and allow to cool. Then fold the sour cream and berries into the puree. In the chilled bowl, whip the cream with an electric mixer at high speed until it holds soft peaks. Do not overbeat. Gently fold the whipped cream into the fruit mixture with a rubber spatula. Cover the mousse and refrigerate until it sets, about 4 hours, or overnight. MAKE THE SAUCE: Combine the raspberries and confectioners sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat until the berries are soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a food processoror blender and puree. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a small bowl and discard the seeds. Stir 2 tablespoons of cold water into the suace to thin. Transfer to a jar and refrigerate. PREPARE THE MOLDING CHOCOLATE: Put both chocolates in the top of a small double boiler over simmering water. Melt over low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula or wooden spoon until the chocolate is very smooth and shiny. Remove from the heat and add the corn syrup and liquor. Using a wooden spoon, mix the chocolate vigorously (the chocolate will start to \\""seize\\""; dont worry, be happy, youre doing just fine) until the chocolate gradually thickens and leaves the sides of the bowl to form a loose, soft mass. The stirring should take no longer than a minute; do not overwork the chocolate or its oils may separate. Divide the chocolate into 2 equal portions. Place one portion in the center of an 11 by 16 inch long sheet of plastic wrap on a cool flat surface. Level the chocolate with a spatula. Cover the chocolate with a second sheet of plastic wrap the same size as the first sheet. Using a rolling pin, gently roll the chocolate into a rectangle about 10 by 15 inches and 1/16 inch thick. Leaving the chocolate still covered, set aside at room temperature away from any heat source for 30 to 45 minutes to partially set. Repeat with remaining chocolate. When the chocolate is partially set, it should be no longer wet by still very pliable. If at first its still too wet to handle, let it sit for about 5 minutes more but do not allow it to harden or it will become difficult to knead. Remove the plastic wrap from one sheet of chocolate. Generously dust a work surface with confectioners sugar. Gather the chocolate into a ball. If the chocolate has dried out and cracks or crumbles a little, dont be concerned, the chocolate will soften and come togther again after kneading. Knead it briefly, pressing it into the confectioners sugar as you knead, until soft and no longer sticky. If it feels sticky, knead in a little more confectioners sugar. The molding chocolate should feel very soft and smooth. Divide the chocolate in half and shape each half into a ball. Cover the balls with plastic wrap and set aside. Knead and shape the remaining sheet of chocolate in the same manner, for a total of 4 chocolate balls. ASSEMBLE THE PURSES: Brush off any chocolate crumbs left on the work surface; the surface should be dry, or the chocolate will stick. Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with confectioners sugar. Slightly flatten one chocolate ball and gently roll it out into a circle about 9 inches in diameter. As you roll the chocolate, be sure to lift it from time to time and dust the surface underneath with a little more confectiners sugar to prevent the chocolate from sticking. Place one quarter (about 13 cup) of the mousse in the center of the chocolate circle. Gather the sides up to enclose the filling. Pinch the purse at the neck to seal in the mousse, allowing the top edges of the purse to fan out. Transfer the purse to a large platter, loosely cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Repeat rolling and filling the remaining balls of chocolate to make 3 more purses. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. TO SERVE: Place a chocolate purse on each chilled dessert plate and spoon some raspberry sauce around it.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Mayan God Painting. Ingredients: Cocoa butter, Powdered food coloring as desired, 2 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered, 2 pounds white chocolate, tempered, Instructions: This technique can be used to make any painted design. I downloaded an image of a Mayan diety from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Allow the paint to dry. Make a raplette: I created a homemade chocolate spreader by using poster board and an X-acto knife. Since my painting is 10 by 16-inches, the opening I will cut in the raplette is 10-inches wide by 1/8-inch high. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely, simply peel off the acetate. Make the frame: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut 2 pieces of chocolate that are 16 inches long and 2 inches wide. Cut 2 more pieces that are 12 inches long by 2 inches wide. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Use a mitre box to trim all 4 ends to 90-degree angles. Just use a gentle sawing motion to cut through each piece. Make the cocoa pods: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many cocoa pods as you would like. Make the leaves: I found plastic leaves at the floral supply store. You can use real leaves if you make sure they are edible. Make sure they are clean and free of dust. Use a dry paintbrush to spread white chocolate on the face of the leaf. When the chocolate sets, peel off the plastic leaf. Now the leaves are ready to paint. I usually use green, yellow and red for leaves and always start with the lightest color first. If you want to paint the cocoa pods and the leaves, there are 2 methods. The first is to mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Then, follow the instructions to make a mold. The second method is to use an airbrush. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. Assembly: Use tempered chocolate to glue the frame pieces to the outside of the painting. Use more tempered chocolate to adhere the leaves to the frame and the cocoa pods to the leaves. Use vegetable oil to glaze the frame to make it shiny.

"Recipe Name: Lemon-Lattice White Chocolate Cake. Ingredients: 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 3 large eggs, 6 large egg yolks, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, 2 tablespoons grated lemon peel, 2 1/4 cups whipping cream, 4 1/2 ounces imported white chocolate (such as Lindt), chopped, 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 3/4 cups sifted all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 4 ounces imported white chocolate (such as Lindt), chopped, 1 cup whipping cream, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, 2 cups sugar, 4 large eggs, separated, Instructions: Combine lemon juice and cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until cornstarch dissolves. Whisk in remaining ingredients. Cook over medium heat until mixture is thick and smooth and just begins to boil, stirring constantly, about 7 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on surface of curd to prevent skin from forming. Refrigerate until chilled, about 6 hours. (Can be prepared days ahead.) Combine 1/2 cup cream and chocolate in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Transfer to large bowl. Whisk in remaining 1 3/4 cups cream and vanilla. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 6 hours. (Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead.) Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Butter three 9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high sides. Line bottoms with waxed paper. Butter paper. Dust pans with flour; tap out excess. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together into medium bowl. Repeat sifting. Stir chocolate and 1/2 cup cream in heavy medium saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Mix in remaining 1/2 cup cream, milk and vanilla. Using electric mixer, beat butter and 1 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in yolks. Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture alternately with white chocolate mixture, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Using electric mix fitted with clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in medium bowl to soft peaks. Gradually beat in remaining 1 cup sugar. Continue beating until stiff but not dry. Fold whites into cake batter in 2 additions. Divide batter among prepared cake pans. Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean and cakes are beginning to pull away from sides of pans, about 24 minutes. Cool cakes in pans on racks 10 minutes. Turn cakes out onto racks, peel off waxed paper and cool completely. (Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Using electric mixer, beat frosting in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Place 1 cake layer on platter. Spread 2/3 cup lemon curd evenly atop cake layer. Spread 3/4 cup frosting atop curd. Top with second cake layer. Spread cake with 2/3 cup curd, then with 3/4 cup frosting. Top with third cake layer. Frost top and sides of entire cake evenly with 3 cups frosting. Place remaining lemon curd in pastry bag fitted with no. 2 star tip. Pipe circle of curd around top of cake, 1/2 inch from edge. Pipe evenly spaced diagonal lines inside circle, creating lattice pattern. (Reserve remaining curd for another use.) Spoon remaining frosting into clean pastry bag fitted with no. 2 star tip. Pipe ruffled border around top and bottom edges of cake. (Can be prepared up to 6 hours ahead. Refrigerate.) Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes before serving.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Grilled Skirt Steak with Artichoke-Potato Hash and Black Olive Aioli. Ingredients: 2 pounds skirt steak, 3 chiles de arbol, thinly sliced, 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper, 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, 1 tablespoon thyme leaves, plus 4 thyme sprigs, 1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, 1 1/4 to 1 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled, 1 bay leaf, 12 baby artichokes, 2/3 cup sliced shallots, 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, 1 bunch arugula, cleaned, Black olive aioli (recipe follows), Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 extra-large egg yolk, 1/2 cup grapeseed oil, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 small clove garlic, 1/4 cup pitted black oil-cured olives, such as Nyons, 1/2 lemon, for juicing, Pinch cayenne pepper, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, Instructions: Trim the skirt steak of excess fat and sinew, if any (it doesnt usually need much trimming). Season the skirt steak with the sliced chiles, cracked black pepper, rosemary, and thyme leaves. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 400F. Toss the potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, the garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon salt. Place in a roasting pan, cover with aluminum foil, and roast about 45 minutes, until tender when pierced. (Depending on the size, age, and variety of potatoes, cooking time will vary.) While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the artichokes. Cut off the top third of the artichokes, and remove the tough outer leaves, down to the pale yellowgreen leaves. Using a paring knife, trim the bottom of the stem and the stalks. Cut each artichoke in half and remove the fuzzy choke if there is one. (If you clean the artichokes ahead of time, immerse them in a bowl of cold water with the juice of one lemon added, to prevent them from turning brown. Be sure to drain and dry them well before cooking.) Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Pour a cup olive oil into the pan, and wait a minute. Add the artichokes, and season with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Turn the heat to medium, and saute about 10 minutes, tossing often, until the artichokes are golden brown. (If the pan seems dry, add another tablespoon or two of olive oil.) When the potatoes have cooled, crumble them into chunky pieces. Squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skin and set aside. Wipe out the artichoke pan and return it to the stove over high heat, for 2 minutes. (To get the potatoes nicely browned and crisp, dont overcrowd them. You may have to use two pans or do it in batches.) Swirl in the remaining a cup olive oil and wait a minute. Add the crumbled potatoes, and season with the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Cook until the potatoes are crispy on one side. (Dont try to move them or turn them if they are stuck to the pan; they will eventually release themselves, just be patient.) After about 8 minutes, when theyve browned nicely on the first side, turn the potatoes in the oil, letting them color on all sides. When the potatoes are golden brown, turn the heat down to medium and add the shallots, artichokes, and roasted garlic. Toss well, and saute the hash together 5 to 6 minutes, until the artichokes are hot and the shallots are translucent. Toss in the chopped parsley just before serving. Light the grill 30 to 40 minutes before cooking, and remove the steak from the refrigerator so it reaches room temperature by the time youre ready to grill it. When the coals are broken down, red, and glowing, season the steak generously with salt, and brush it lightly with olive oil. Place the meat on the hottest part of the grill, to get a nice sear on the outside. Cook about 2 minutes, turn the meat a quarter-turn, and cook another minute. Turn the meat over, and move it to a cooler spot on the grill. Cook another minute or two for medium-rare. Rest the steak on a wire rack set over a baking sheet for a few minutes. Arrange the artichoke-potato hash on a large warm platter, and scatter the arugula leaves over the top. Slice the steak against the grain, and lay the slices over the potatoes and artichokes. Spoon some of the black olive aioli over the meat, and pass the rest at the table. Place the egg yolk in a stainless steel bowl. Begin whisking in the grapeseed oil drop by drop, as slowly as you can bear. Continue in this manner, following with the olive oil, as the mixture thickens. Once the mayonnaise has emulsified, add the remaining oil in a slow steady stream, whisking all the time. If the mixture gets too thick and is difficult to whisk, add a drop or two of water. Pound the garlic with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a mortar. Add half the olives and pound to a paste. Roughly chop the remaining olives. Fold the garlic-olive paste and the chopped olives into the mayonnaise. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, a squeeze of lemon juice, and the cayenne pepper. Taste for balance and seasoning. If the aioli seems thick and gloppy, thin it with a little water; this will also make it creamier. Season the steak with the chiles, pepper, and herbs the night before cooking. You can roast the potatoes and saute the artichokes ahead of time. Saute them together to make the hash just before serving; the hash can sit in the pan while you finish the steaks. You can make the aioli a few hours ahead as well.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Oven Roasted Beef Tenderloin with Citrus-Chanterelle Vinaigrette Warm Sesame-Spinach Roulade and Risotto Cake. Ingredients: 2 tablespoons rock sugar or brown sugar, 3/4 cup red wine, 2 medium sized shallots, chopped, 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger, 1/2 cup green onion, chopped, 1/4 cup cilantro, 2 sprigs fresh thyme, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons red miso, 1 cup canola oil, 2 pounds cleaned beef tenderloin, cut into 4 (8-ounce) portions, 1 1/2 cups shallots, chopped, 1/2 tablespoon chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger, 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only, 3 cups chanterelles, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 cup mushroom stock, 2 tablespoons mushroom soy sauce or soy sauce, 1 lemon, juiced, 1 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup truffle oil, Salt and pepper, to taste, 3 cups chicken stock, 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup onion, small dice, 1 tablespoon chopped garlic, 2 cups canaroli rice, 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 cup Parmesan, plus a little for sprinkling, 1/2 cup reserved chanterelle mushroom mixture, from above recipe, roughly chopped, 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped, 2 tablespoons chives, chopped, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon canola oil, Salt and pepper, to taste, Instructions: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the rock sugar with the red wine and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine the shallots, garlic, ginger, green onion, cilantro, thyme, red miso, soy sauce, reserved red wine, and the oil. Mix well. Add the beef to the mixture and marinate for 4 to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare an oven safe, medium saute pan over high heat. Season the beef with the salt and pepper. Sear the beef for 2 minutes. Place the pan in the oven to finish cooking, about 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare. Take care that the beef does not burn as the marinade contains sugar. In a large saute pan over high heat, cook the shallots, garlic, ginger, and thyme, for 4 to 6 minutes. Add the chanterelle and cook for another 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine, then add the mushroom stock and the soy sauce. Set aside 1/2 cup of the mixture to be used in the risotto cake. Extract about 8 of the larger mushrooms to be used as garnish. Reduce the liquid by 1/3 and then puree the mixture in a blender. Add the lemon juice, canola oil, and truffle oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken stock in a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep warm. Coat a large saucepan over medium heat with the olive oil. Sweat the onions and garlic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the rice and saute for 4 additional minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and reduce until almost dry. Slowly add the warm chicken stock allowing the rice to absorb the liquid. Stir the rice occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Keep adding the chicken stock until the rice is cooked al dente. Season with salt and pepper and add the reserved mushrooms, herbs, cheese, and butter. Spinach Roulade: 2 pounds spinach 3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 teaspoon Korean chile flakes Salt and pepper, to taste Bring a stockpot filled with salted water to a boil. Quickly blanch the spinach and then immediately plunge it into a bowl of ice water. Strain the spinach from the water and allow to dry. In a mixing bowl, combine the spinach, sesame seeds, sesame oil, Korean chile flakes, salt and pepper. Place the spinach mixture in the middle of a 12 by 12-inch piece of aluminum foil. Fold the mixture to form a roll with a one-inch diameter and twist the ends of the foil to secure the spinach. Place the foiled roll in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Remove the roulade from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature. Using a serrated knife cut the roulade with foil intact into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Be sure to remove the foil before serving. Sesame Dressing: 2 tablespoons sesame paste 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 1/2 cup canola oil 1 shallot, chopped 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger Salt and pepper, to taste In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the sesame paste, rice wine vinegar, canola oil, shallot, ginger, salt, and pepper. Set aside. Garnish Red Radish Salad: 1 tablespoon truffle oil 1 teaspoon lemon juice 10 radishes, julienned 1 tablespoon chives, chopped Salt and pepper, to taste In a small mixing bowl, combine the truffle oil and the lemon juice. Add the radishes and chives and season with the salt and pepper. Set aside. Plating: Place the risotto near the top of the plate with the roulade resting on top of the risotto. Drizzle the sesame dressing over the roulade and sprinkle with sesame seeds, and then add the radish on top of the roulade. Cut the beef in half and rest it against the cake. Drizzle the vinaigrette around the plate and garnish with the reserved chanterelles, about 2 per plate.","```cypher
