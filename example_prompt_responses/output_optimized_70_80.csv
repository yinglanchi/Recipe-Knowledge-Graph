"Recipe Name: Creme De Maple (Maple Pudding). Ingredients: 2 Egg yolks... (or 2 whole eggs * Refer to the bottom of the ingredients list), 1 Egg, 250 ml Heavy cream (a fat content of 45% or more is recommended)...A, 175 ml Milk...A, 45 grams Maple sugar (can be substituted with granulated sugar)...A, 1 (1/2 vanilla bean) or (1/3 teaspoon vanilla bean paste) (Vanilla bean) or (Vanilla bean paste)...A, 150 ml Heavy cream (leftover from the pudding mixture)...B, 12 grams Granulated sugar...B, 4 ml Maple syrup...B, Instructions: Take the eggs out of the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before starting to make the pudding mixture. Put all the A ingredients in a pan. Cook over low heat stirring occasionally until the maple sugar dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches about 40-50 C, remove the pan from the heat. Cool the mixture from Step 2 to about 30C. If the mixture is too warm, the egg will form lumps. Cooling the mixture too much is not good either. Make sure to cool it to about 30C. Combine the egg yolk and the whole egg with a whisk taking care not to make it foamy. Tilt the bowl and move the whisk in straight lines as though you are \\""cutting\\"" the egg white. Gradually add the mixture from Step 3 into the Step 4 eggs stirring constantly with a whisk. Once all the mixture is added, stir it well. Strain the mixture from Step 5 through a fine strainer at least once . The egg white has small lumps which will change the smoothness of the final product, so always strain the mixture. Pour the Step 6 mixture into a heatproof container. I strain the mixture into a measuring cup before adding it to a container. Strain again from the measuring cup to the heatproof container. This mini ramekin holds 55 ml of the mixture. (Ramekin size: 6 cm diameter x 5.8 cm height). Cover the containers with aluminum foil. * If the container has a lid, use it to cover the container. Pour some boiling water into a baking tray, place the containers from Step 10 into it and steam bake in a 160C oven for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 140C and bake for another 25 minutes. The cooking time varies by the size of the container and the oven that you are using. For reference, the mini ramekins from Step 9 took 15 minutes at 160C and 13 minutes in 130C. I have explained how to steam bake in the oven here. If you prefer to steam the pudding on the stove, refer to the \\""Puko chans recipe\\"". See my recipe blog for how to steam food in \\""Staub Mini Round Cocotte\\"". (Japanese only) \\""Once a film forms on the surface and the mixture does not fall apart when you tilt the container\\"" or \\""the center of the pudding jiggles when you gently shake the container\\"" is the perfect time to remove it from the heat. This is the perfect pudding described in Step 15. This is fresh from oven and barely solid. It is very smooth and creamy. This is the cross section. The texture is in between a thick cream and solid, but it is set. The bottom part has a creamier texture. This is after refrigerating the pudding for 2 hours. It is creamy, but has a much more solid texture than the texture of Step 17s pudding. The heat of my electric oven is rather weak. Check the state after cooking for 15 minutes at 140C. If the state is as shown in Steps 15 to 17, the pudding is done. If the pudding is not quite done, add more boiling water to the baking tray and bake it while checking every 5 minutes. If you are making this recipe for the first time, boil some water while baking the pudding. Be careful to not overcook as wonderful texture will be ruined. It may seem loose right out of the oven, but it will solidify while chilling. Cool the pudding from Step 15 to room temperature. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill completely in the refrigerator. Chill the pudding for more than 8 hours and it is done. Drizzle on some maple syrup and enjoy. My goal was to make a copy-cat recipe of the \\""Appalaches Maple Pudding\\"" from the sweets store \\""Le Chocolatier Takagi\\"". This is the \\""Appalaches Maple Pudding\\"". This pudding is genius It comes with maple syrup to pour on. The pudding is topped with smooth and creamy creme Chantilly. It is super delicious and I love it. Now back to my recipe... When the pudding from Step 22 is chilled for about 1-2 hours, add all the B ingredients in a bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Spread evenly onto the pudding. Chill the pudding again for at least 5 hours. I like the texture after chilling it overnight. Look how perfect it is! It is delicious enough as it is, but you can drizzle on some maple syrup for an even nicer touch. This is the top layer. The hardened creme Chantilly, the pudding and the maple syrup are exquisite. Next, you will encounter the smooth and creamy pudding layer. The maple syrup coats the pudding and melts in your mouth. And then comes the even creamier pudding layer. It is almost a cream-like pudding that melts in your mouth. And the bottom layer is a thick and smooth cream layer. Its great eating this luxurious custard cream. These multiple textures give different enjoyments at each layer. Please enjoy this patisserie quality \\""Creme de Maple\\"". See an easy standard custard pudding recipe that you can make with ingredients on hand at (Recipe ID 1868649): \\""Mamas Melt-in-Your Mouth Custard Pudding\\"". This is an easy creamy pudding with gelatin, \\""Cafe Mocha Pudding\\"".","```

"Recipe Name: South by Southwest. Ingredients: 6 scallions, top 2 inches of green removed, 2 tablespoons umeboshi paste (Japanese pickled plum paste, available in natural foods stores or Japanese food shops), 6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves, 6 tablespoons toasted sesame butter or tahini, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, Instructions: Place all ingredients in a food processor and puree until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving. 2 cups cornmeal 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour 1 cup unbleached white flour 3 tablespoons baking powder 2 cups soy milk 1/2 cup canola oil 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/3 cup maple syrup 3 tablespoons olive oil Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Sift cornmeal, flours and baking powder into a large bowl. Mix well. In a separate bowl, whisk together the soy milk, oil, salt, and syrup. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, stirring just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Oil an 11-inch round cast iron skillet with the olive oil. Over high heat, heat the oil until it starts to smoke. Pour the batter into the heating skillet. Bake approximately 40 minutes, or until the cornbread is firm to the touch and a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool before slicing. 3 cups dried red beans, soaked overnight 3 bay leaves 2 tablespoons sea salt 3 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, diced 1/2-inch 2 large carrots, diced 1/2-inch 4 stalks celery, diced 1/2-inch 2 small butternut squash, skinned and diced 3/4 inch 1 small red bell pepper, diced 1/2-inch 1 small green bell pepper, diced 1/2-inch 1/4 jalapeno pepper, minced (about 1 teaspoon) 1/4 cup minced garlic 4 cups diced okra or zucchini, 1/2-inch cubes 1 tablespoon chili powder 3 tablespoons dried sage 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 1 small (6-ounce) can tomato paste 2 cups canned whole tomatoes with juice 2 cups water or vegetable stock 1/4 cup tamari 1 cup minced cilantro leaves Drain and rinse the beans. Place the beans in a medium saucepan with the bay leaves and add enough water to cover the beans by 1-inch. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 35 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of salt in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Beans will still be tough. They will complete their cooking in the stew. Reserve both the beans and the cooking juices while completing the preparation of the stew. Over medium to high heat in a large pot heat the oil, onions and carrots, cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the celery, squash, bell peppers, jalapeno, and garlic, cook 5 minutes more. Add the okra, spices, remaining salt, and the tomato paste. In a food processor, puree the whole tomatoes with their juice until you have a tomato soup-like consistency. Stir the tomato mixture into the vegetables. Add the beans, the bean cooking juice, and the water or vegetable stock. Cover and simmer until beans are tender, about 20 minutes. Add the tamari and cilantro. Serve hot. 1 bunch kale, trimmed, sliced diagonally into 1/4-inch strips (about 10 cups) 1 bunch collard greens, trimmed, sliced diagonally into 1/4-inch strips, (about 10 cups) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 cup minced garlic 1 large onion, sliced thin (about 2 cups) 1/2 tablespoon sea salt 2 tablespoons tamari Steam the greens about 2 to 3 minutes in a steamer basket. Set aside. Heat the oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the cooked greens and salt, tossing with the onions and garlic, cook until greens are softened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the tamari and serve hot.","

"Recipe Name: Cajun Shrimp W/ Red Peppers Angel Hair Pasta and Cayenne Alfredo. Ingredients: 1 lb pre-cooked shrimp, 15 ounces alfredo sauce, 2 teaspoons creole seasoning, 1 -2 tablespoon lemon juice, 8 -12 ounces angel hair pasta or 8 -12 ounces pasta, of your choice, 18 lb butter, 3 -4 tablespoons olive oil, 12 medium yellow onion, 1 -1 12 red bell pepper (use only fresh peppers, not frozen), 18-14 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon lemon pepper (use the kind without salt), 3 -4 garlic, gloves to taste, 2 tablespoons chicken base (paste) or 4 bullion cubes in an 8-quart stock pot filled 3/4 with water, Instructions: Preparations: Defrost shrimp (if needed) in cold water (20-30 minutes), remove tails off the shrimp, drain and set aside. Dice onion and garlic. Cut the top off the bell peppers, remove seeds and interior meat and slice bell peppers into strips suitable for eating and set vegetables aside. Prepare water for boiling.the pasta and mix in chicken soup base in the water to flavor the pasta. Get the grill started and let it get hot. In a cup or small bowl combine 1/2 the butter, (melted) and lemon juice enough to brush both sides of the shrimp once on the grill. In a large pan pour about 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the pan. In a separate cup, pour the rest of the olive oil or as much olive oil into it as you think you need to coat the grates of your grill. I have a gas-fired grill, but electric or charcoal grills will work also. If you try to fry the shrimp in a pan or stove-top grill it wont turn out as good because the shrimp will sit in too much moisture. Cooking: It takes about 10 minutes for the pasta to cook and about the same time to cook up the peppers and shrimp. You have to cook three things at once for a few minutes and move fast. I never seem to remember the sequence exactly but it goes something like this:. Get your pasta water boiling on high. Make sure your grill is hot. Turn the heat on your pan to high to heat up the olive oil.- dont let it burn. Brush the grates on your grill with olive oil - it helps to keep the shrimp from sticking to the grill. Allow the oil on the grates to heat up. Return to the pan. Once the olive oil in the pan is hot, toss in the garlic, onions and peppers. Turn down heat to medium-high heat and let the onions and garlic caramelize with the peppers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Toss the pasta in the water and cook for required time. Usually 8-10 minutes - DONT overcook or undercook it. Stir occasionally. Take shrimp and place on the grill. Quickly brush lemon butter over each piece of shrimp. Sprinkle (not to heavy here) with Creole seasoning and lemon pepper. Close the lid and let cook 3- 5 minutes on each side. Go back to the pan and turn pepper, union, garlic mixture. Dont let onion or garlic burn, but cook peppers until tender-crisp only. Turn down heat if necessary. It will take the peppers a little time 7-10 minutes) to start softening. Stir and check pasta. After about 3-5 minutes on the grill turn the shrimp over, brush again with lemon butter and sprinkle with spices, close lid. Usually the shrimp will get done before the other ingredients. Try not to overcook the shrimp here, it will still cook slightly after adding to the pan. If the other ingredients are done or getting done, take them off the heat until shrimp is done. Keep a watchful eye on your foods. Once the shrimp is done on the grill, the should be slightly firm, slightly browned, yet tender. Add grilled shrimp to peppers in the pan once the peppers are tender-crisp. Turn heat down to low-medium. Pour in enough alfredo sauce to coat all the shrimp and peppers. I use a store-bought sauce. If you know how to make your own Alfredo sauce - go for it. My preference when it comes to Alfredo sauce is to taste it without having my food swim in it. If you like your food to swim in the sauce- add more Alfredo. Stir. Bring sauce to a slight simmer then turn heat down to low. Sprinkle Cayenne pepper lightly over the mixture a little bit at a time. Stir. Taste. Add more cayenne if necessary. Too much cayenne and you spoil it, Too little cayenne and the dish lacks the flavor. It should be just enough to taste the cayenne pepper and alfredo sauce without it being too hot on the tongue. Once you have it just right, cover the pan with a lid but keep warm to let the flavors meld together while you get the pasta and serving dishes ready. Do not let the sauce simmer at this point or the shrimp will and peppers may be overcooked. Drain pasta and add butter (dont overdo it) as angel hair tends to stick together. Stir. Serving:. You can prepare each place individually to ensure each person gets an equal share of the shrimp and peppers with pasta or I like to place the pasta in one bowl and the shrimp, pepper mixture in a large serving dish. People can then take as much pasta as they want and then place the shrimp/pepper/sauce mixture over the top of the pasta. It may not look real pretty and people eating this for the first time may want just a \\""little taste\\"" before they come back for more. Yet, despite appearances, the aroma, flavors and different textures will be good. Usually, this will serve 4 people. If you make a whole box of pasta, some of it gets wasted - that is why I suggest using half to 3/4 of the box. If you like more sauce, add it to the shrimp/pepper mixture when cooking so you have some extra. You can experiment with different pastas, but I have found that the angel hair is a nice compliment to the delicate shrimp and the pasta should have a slight flavor of its own than blends in nicely with the shrimp and peppers. The peppers, if good and fresh will have an almost sweet taste to offset the spices, but be an excellent match with the shrimps texture. This goes great with a nice spring-mix type salad, crispy bread and a good bottle of Petite Syrah (red) wine or a quality (white) Chardonnay followed with a small amount of raspberry sorbet to cleanse the palate. .","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Butter Poached Lobster Ravioli. Ingredients: 2 pounds semolina flour, Pinch sea salt, 1 dozen eggs, Water, as needed, 2 (2-pound) lobsters, 1/2 -ounce clarified butter (substitute oil if needed), 6 ounces celery, coarsely chopped, 6 ounces carrots, coarsely chopped, 12 ounces yellow onion, coarsely chopped, 8 cups water plus 1 tablespoon water, 9 ounces unsalted butter, 1 cup white wine, Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, Lobster stock (from above), 1/2 bottle bourbon (approximately 1 1/2 cups), 1 vanilla bean, 2 sprigs thyme, 2 1/2 ounces butter, Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 pound celeriac, large dice, 2 cups heavy cream, 2 ounces unsalted butter, Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 ounces unsalted butter, 10 ounces yellow onion, diced small, 2 1/2 ounces fennel, shaved thinly, 5 ounces yellow chanterelles, coarsely chopped, 1 sprig tarragon, leaves chopped, 2 sprig sage, leaves chopped, 1/2 cup white wine, 2 ounces butter, Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, Instructions: For the Pasta Dough: Put the first 2 ingredients into a mixing bowl and mix briefly. Make a well in the flour and add eggs into it. Mix the eggs into the flour and knead the mixture with your hands until smooth. Add water only as needed to reach desired consistency. Avoid adding more than necessary. Flatten dough slightly and cover with plastic. Chill dough in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. For the Lobster Filling: Drop the lobsters in boiling water for no more than 45 seconds to a minute. Separate the tail, body, and claws. Split the tail and remove the meat. Crack the claws and knuckles open and remove their meat setting aside the meat from the larger claw and its knuckles. Smash the shells (including the body) with a cleaver or meat mallet. Covering the shells with a kitchen towel first helps avoid making a mess. Heat the clarified butter in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium/high heat. Add the lobster shells, celery, carrots, and onions. Cook until the mixture caramelizes. This may take up to a half hour. Keep the heat on medium to high. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the brown residue from the bottom of the pot. Add the water (should be enough to cover the contents of the pot. If not add more) and simmer for about 45 minutes. While this lobster stock is cooking, cut 8 ounces butter into small cubes. Place them in a small saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of water. Heat the butter slowly whisking it with the water until fully melted. Add the lobster tail meat and the claw and knuckle meat from the smaller claw. Cook the meat in the butter over low heat for a total of about 5 minutes. Check the claw and knuckle meat after about 3 minutes. When cooked, remove the meat from the butter and set aside to cool slightly. Cut the tail and knuckle meat into small cubes. The claw meat will break up in your fingers. Returning to the lobster stock, strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve saving the stock and discarding the rest. Pour the stock into a clean saucepot, return to the stove and bring to a boil. Continue at a rolling boil until it has reduced down to about a quart of liquid. Remove half of the liquid and set it aside. Add the white wine and reduce again this time down as much as possible. When fully reduced, the bubbles from boiling will be much tighter. There may be as little as a tablespoon of liquid left. Reduce the heat to low and whisk in the 1-ounce of butter. Set this wine reduction aside. In a food processor puree the claw and knuckle meat from the larger claw (that you set aside earlier) until it is a smooth paste. Fold the poached lobster meat and about a tablespoon of the wine reduction into the pureed meat. Add a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate filling until ready to use. For the Vanilla Bourbon Sauce: Combine the lobster stock set aside from the filling, the bourbon, vanilla bean, and thyme in a saucepot and bring to a rolling boil. When the mixture has reduced by about half remove the thyme and discard. Remove the vanilla bean and set aside. Continue reducing the liquid until it thickens. Reduce heat to low. Split the vanilla bean and scrape its seeds. Add the seeds to the sauce and discard the pod. Cube up the butter and whisk it, bit by bit, into the sauce to finish it. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. For the Celeriac Puree: Place the diced celeriac in a medium saucepot and pour the cream over it. Cut a disk out of parchment paper just big enough to cover the celeriac (the inner diameter of the pot). Using this to cover the mixture instead of a pot lid will help prevent boil-over. Cook the mixture on low heat for 45 minutes or until celeriac is very tender. Remove paper and strain the mixture reserving both the celeriac and the cream. In a food processor puree the celeriac. Add just enough cream to make a smooth puree. Season with salt and pepper. For the Chanterelle Mushroom Ragout: Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, for about 15 minutes and then add the fennel. When this mixture has caramelized (may take about 15 minutes) add the chanterelles and the herbs. Add the wine and cook until it reduces by two thirds. Swirl in the butter and season, to taste, with salt and pepper. For the Ravioli: Roll the pasta dough out into sheets using a pasta roller. Brush 1 sheet at a time lightly with egg wash. Spoon small mounds of filling (about 1 teaspoon each) onto 1 side of the dough - about 1-inch apart. Fold the dough over the filling and press it together just around the filling working outward. Cut the ravioli with a pasta wheel or with a ring mold. If making a large batch, freeze the ravioli. This will make cooking them much easier. If not, cover and refrigerate until needed. Just before service, cook the ravioli in a large pot of salted boiling water for about 4 minutes. To plate: Pipe 3 small mounds of the celeriac puree in a row in the center of the plate. Gently set 1 ravioli on each mound slanted upward. Spoon some of the mushroom ragout around the side of the ravioli and drizzle sauce on the plate. If edible flowers or fresh herb sprigs are available they can be used as a garnish.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Chiarellos Classic Omelet Technique. Ingredients: 3 large eggs per person, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, per omelet, Melted butter, optional, Spinaci alla Padella, recipe follows, Grilled Red Onions, recipe follows, Salami Bits, recipe follows, Caponata \\""Agrodolce\\"", recipe follows, Instructions: Break the eggs into a bowl and season with salt and pepper; lightly beat with a fork. Heat a 10-inch nonstick saute pan with 1 teaspoon unsalted butter. When butter begins to crackle pour in beaten eggs and cook for 10 seconds, just so the eggs begin to set on the bottom. Immediately scrape the sides towards the middle using a plastic utensil. Stir almost continuously until the omelet is cooked to your liking. Allow 2 minutes for a well cooked omelet. To roll the omelet, flip one half over toward the middle, while tilting the pan. Add the filling of your choice and continue rolling omelet over itself. Roll the omelet on to a serving plate. Make a slit with a paring knife to expose some of the filling and drizzle some melted butter on top, if desired. *Chefs Note: To serve a make-your-own omelet bar, make omelets to order and offer toppings: Spinaci alla Padella, Grilled Red Onions, Salami Bits, Caponata and a selection of cheeses. 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt 4 (10-ounce) bags spinach, washed, big stems removed, or 12 cups raw, roughly torn mustard greens (about 2 pounds) About 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper Lemon wedges Bring 1 gallon of water to boil in a large pot with 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt. Add the spinach, pushing it down into the water with a skimmer, and immediately remove it to a bowl of ice water. Drain the spinach once cooled (dont leave it in for too long) and squeeze out the water. Divide spinach into 4 sections and compress each into a ball (each ball will be about 1 cup and they can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to a day). Cut each ball in half and then in half again to chop up the spinach. Place 1/4 cup of the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the garlic to the pan and shake the pan often, for about 1 minute or until the garlic is lightly browned. Add the spinach and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste. It will seem dry. Remove the spinach to a bowl, sprinkle with a little olive oil and garnish with lemon wedges. Variations: Try adding some chopped anchovy with the garlic. For creamed spinach: substitute butter for half of the oil and add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream as you cook the spinach. Yield: 4 servings 2 red onions, peeled and sliced 1/2-inch thick Olive oil Salt and freshly ground black pepper Preheat a grill or a grill pan. Lightly brush the onion slices with olive oil. Place on the grill and cook about 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and chop into bite-sized pieces or serve whole. Yield: about 3 cups 1 pound salami, very finely minced or ground with the medium blade of a meat grinder 2 tablespoons olive oil Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Place salami in heated pan. Drizzle salami with olive oil, and cook, stirring. The salami will give off steam in about 5 minutes while it releases its moisture. When the hiss of steam turns to a sizzle, turn the heat down to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the salami bits are crisp, about 15 to 20 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bits to several thicknesses of paper towel to drain. The bits will crisp even more as they cool. Use immediately or freeze the bits for up to 6 months and warm in a skillet, as needed. Yield: 1 pound Recipe courtesy Mariano Orlando 1 cup olive oil, for frying, plus more if needed 3 medium eggplants, cut into small dice 3 small green zucchini, quartered and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 3 small yellow squash, quartered and cut into 1/4-inch pieces 2 onions, chopped 1/4-inch pieces 6 celery ribs, cut into 1/4-inch slices 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1 1/2 cups red wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sugar 1 cup roasted red peppers, thinly sliced 1 cup kalamata olives, pitted and chopped 1 cup capers Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves 2 cups prepared marinara sauce In a very hot pan, separately cook the vegetables over a medium-high flame with a bit of the olive oil. Cook the onions and the garlic together in the same pan in a little more oil. Set all cooked vegetables aside in a large bowl. Make the \\""agrodolce\\"": Combine vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan and reduce by half over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes. While vegetables are still warm, combine with the roasted peppers, olives, and capers. Pour the \\""agrodolce\\"" vinegar over the vegetable mixture and toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the chopped herbs and marinara sauce and stir. Serve the caponata at room temperature. Yield: 10 to 12 servings","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Chicken Spinach Tortellini Soup or Chicken Soup. Ingredients: 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 cup diced onion, 4 garlic cloves, pressed, 6 cups chicken broth (see Note) or 6 cups homemade chicken stock (see Note), 12 teaspoon poultry seasoning, 12 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, 2 cups cooked chicken, cut into 1-inch cubes (rotisserie chicken from the market or leftover homemade), 1 lb Baby Spinach, stems trimmed and larger leaves torn in half, 2 diced tomatoes or 1 medium can diced peeled tomatoes, 12 lb pre-made cheese tortellini (from the market refrigerator case or freezer), grated parmesan cheese (to garnish) (optional), Instructions: Heat a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Add olive oil and onions. Saute, stirring often, until onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir-fry another 2 minutes. Add chicken broth, poultry seasoning, and pepper to the pot. Bring to a low boil. Reduce heat, add tortellini, and simmer until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in cooked chicken, spinach, and tomatoes. Cook an additional 5 minutes, gently stirring occasionally, until spinach is limp but still nicely green. Garnish with Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve soup hot with crusty bread and a fresh green salad for a complete meal. Note: If you like a strong chicken flavor, add a bouillon cube or 1 teaspoon bouillon granules or paste to the hot broth. I have made this soup and every time I make it someone wants the recipe. I made it with rotisserie chicken and also used the new chicken w/herb bouillon cubes. Served it with a small side salad. Excellent. Better than a soup made from scratch! Tips: Although its fairly difficult to ruin soup, here are some tips and hints to help you produce the most flavorful, satisfying result. Always begin with cold water, never warm or hot. When tasting to adjust flavors, use a stainless steel spoon, not a wooden or sterling silver spoon. Wood and silver disguise flavor on the tongue. A good soup really needs salt, preferably coarse salt. If you must avoid salt, know that the flavor will be greatly diminished. Adding no-salt or low-sodium broth concentrate will help. Dont turn your nose up at this: Chicken feet add not only robust flavor, but gelatinous body to the soup. You can find them at many Asian markets. Fresh chicken feet need to be scalded about five minutes so the skin and toenails can be removed before adding to the stockpot. Calf feet, veal knuckles and beef marrow bones achieve the same goal. Bones also leach nutritious calcium and minerals into the soup. If at all possible, do not use chicken that has been frozen. Freezing forces moisture from the tissues. When the bird is thawed, all that moisture ends up down the drain, leaving a dry and tasteless chicken. Unthawed frozen vegetables should not be added to the soup until the last 15 minutes of cooking time. Use tall, nonreactive stockpots for making soup. Fit the bird to the pot. The base should be just large enough to hold the bird and to cover it with a minimum of water. A pot of heavy construction distributes heat more evenly. To skim or not to skim? For clear soups, many recipes advocate skimming off the foamy solids that rise to the top as the soup cooks. However, there is not only flavor, but nutrition in those solids that will break down as the soup cooks. You can sieve the broth before adding vegetables. For a clearer broth, sift through cheesecloth. Or, you can skim. The choice is yours. Dont let the soup boil. It should simmer very gently or the meat will become tough and the broth cloudy. Dark meat has more flavor than white meat. If you are using chicken parts rather than a whole chicken, keep this in mind. Using only all white meat will result in a much less flavorful result. For those concerned about fat, make the soup in two stages. Cook the chicken with its aromatic vegetables and herbs on one day. Strain the meat and flavorings from the broth. Refrigerate the broth until the fat solidifies on top. Save the fat for other uses or discard. Continue with the soup. Do keep in mind that the majority of the flavor is in the fat. If you are planning ahead, cook the chicken with vegetables and herbs. Freeze the strained stock. If your planned future use includes chicken meat, freeze the meat in the stock to keep it from drying out. You can later thaw and add fresh vegetables, pasta or rice. For a richer broth, remove the chicken from the bones as soon as it is tender and refrigerate. Add the bones back to the soup and continue simmering until desired strength is achieved. Strain and proceed. Cool soup completely before freezing or refrigerating, preferably by placing the pot in a sink of ice and stirring. The pot should be uncovered while it is cooling. In the Kitchen Basic chicken soup begins with a broth made by cooking the chicken with savory vegetables (such as onions, carrots, and celery) and herbs (usually sage, thyme, bay leaf and parsley). From the basic stock, you can vary your soup by adding your favorite vegetables, pasta or rice. Combinations for chicken soup are as limitless as your imagination. The chicken soup recipe collection covers a wide variety to give you an idea how versatile this family favorite can be, from classic chicken noodle soup to mulligatawny. Remember, turkey can be substituted for chicken in most recipes. Above all, the prime ingredient in chicken soup is love. Luckily, it is the one ingredient accessible to all in infinite quantities, and you cannot use too much of it.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Tunisian Lamb-and-Eggplant Stew with Farro, Parsley, and Harissa. Ingredients: 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, 3 pounds lamb shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-to-2-inch chunks, 6 cloves garlic, smashed, 3 chiles de arbol, crumbled, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 cups diced onion, 2 bay leaves, fresh if possible, 3/4 cup San Marzano canned tomatoes, crushed, 1/2 cup lemon juice, 2 1/2 cups veal stock, 2 1/2 cups chicken stock, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon allspice berries, tied in cheesecloth, 2 medium eggplants, Farro with parsley and butter (recipe follows), Harissa (recipe follows), 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup diced onion, 1 tablespoon thyme leaves, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 chiles de arbol, crumbled, 1 bay leaf, preferably fresh, 1 1/2 cups farro (spelt), 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 6 dried ancho chiles, seeded, membranes removed, 1/3 cup San Marzano canned tomatoes, 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 clove garlic, chopped, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, A healthy pinch cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sherry vinegar, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 lemon, for juicing, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, Instructions: Toast the caraway seeds in a small pan for a few minutes, until the seeds release their aroma and darken slightly. Using a mortar and pestle, pound the seeds coarsely. Repeat with the coriander. Place the lamb in a large bowl with the caraway, coriander, smashed garlic, chiles, paprika, cayenne, and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Using your hands, toss the lamb, spices, and oil together to coat the meat well. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Take the meat out of the refrigerator 45 minutes before cooking. After 15 minutes, season it on all sides with 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons salt and lots of pepper. Reserve the garlic. Preheat the oven to 325F. Heat a large Dutch oven over high heat for 3 minutes. Pour in 3 tablespoons olive oil and wait a minute or two, until the pan is very hot, almost smoking. Place the meat in the pan, being careful not to crowd it. (You will most likely need to do this in two batches.) Sear the meat until its well browned and caramelized on all sides. (This step is very important and should not be rushed; it may take15 to 20 minutes.) As the batches of meat are browned, remove them to a baking sheet or platter. Turn the heat down to medium and add the onion, bay leaves, and reserved garlic. Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the crusty bits left in the pan. Cook about 5 minutes, until the onions are caramelized. Add the crushed tomatoes and lemon juice and cook 2 minutes, stirring continuously to coat the onions. Add the stocks, cinnamon, and allspice. Bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the lamb and its juices to the pot. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and a tight-fitting lid, if you have one. Braise the lamb in the oven about 3 hours. While the lamb is braising, cut the eggplant into 1-inch cubes. Toss them with salt, and place them in a colander for 10 minutes to drain. Pat the eggplant cubes dry with paper towels. Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Swirl in 3 tablespoons olive oil, and wait 1 minute. Add the eggplant to the pan, and let sear a minute or two. (Do not crowd the pan; you may need to do this in batches.) Once it starts to color, turn the eggplant cubes to achieve a nice color on all sides. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until tender and golden. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. To check the meat for doneness, carefully remove the lid and foil, being mindful of the hot steam. Spoon a piece of meat out of the pan and press it with your thumb or a spoon. If its done, it will yield easily and almost fall apart. If its not super-tender, cover again and return the pot to the oven. When the meat is done, remove from the oven and turn the temperature up to 400F. Ladle most of the braising juices into a strainer set over a saucepan, leaving an inch or two of juices in the pan with the lamb. Press down on the vegetables with the ladle to extract all the juices. Discard the cinnamon stick and allspice. Return the lamb to the oven for about 15 minutes, to caramelize it. Skim the fat from the braising juices. Reduce the broth over medium-high heat to thicken it slightly, if necessary. Taste for seasoning. Stir the eggplant in with the browned lamb, and pour the hot broth over the top, stirring to coat well. Transfer the farro onto a large warm platter. Spoon the braised lamb, along with the eggplant and cooking juices, over the farro. Dollop the harissa over the meat, scatter the parsley on top, and serve the remaining harissa and braising juices on the side. Heat a medium saucepan over high heat for 1 minute. Swirl in the olive oil, and add the diced onion, thyme, cinnamon stick, chiles, and bay leaf. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often, until the onion is translucent. Add the farro, stirring to coat it with the oil, and toast it slightly. Add 8 cups water and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, and simmer about 30 minutes, until the farro is tender and just cooked through. Drain the farro and discard the cinnamon stick, chiles, and bay leaf. Toss the hot farro with the butter. When all the butter has melted, stir in the parsley and a few grindings of black pepper. Taste for seasoning. Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 1 minute. Add the chiles to the pan and dry-toast them for a few minutes until they are blistered and slightly darkened. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with very hot water. Let them sit, covered, 15 minutes. Return the pan to the stove and add the tomato. Cook over medium heat for a few minutes until the juices reduce and the tomato is slightly darkened. Meanwhile, toast the cumin in a small pan over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes, until the seeds release their aroma and darken slightly. Pound them coarsely in a mortar. Drain the chiles well and place them in a food processor with the garlic, tomatoes, paprika, cumin, cayenne, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Puree until well combined. With the motor running, slowly pour in the olive oil and blend until incorporated. Season with a healthy squeeze of lemon juice, and more salt if you like. The lamb, like all braises, can be made a day or even 2 days ahead of time. Remember to marinate it overnight before braising. The harissa can also can be made ahead, and keeps for a few weeks in the refrigerator. Make the farro within an hour of serving. I like it best just after its been cooked and tossed with the butter. Hold it in a warm oven for up to 30 minutes, if thats more convenient for you.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Lemon Cake with Apricot Glaze. Ingredients: Cooking spray, 1 18.25-ounce package lemon cake mix, 6 large egg whites, 1/2 cup water, 1 1/2 tablespoons grated lemon zest, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 3/4 cup all-fruit apricot preserves, 1 cup frozen fat-free whipped topping, thawed in refrigerator, Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325F. Lightly spray a 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan with cooking spray. Put the cake mix, egg whites, water, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl. Mix using the package directions. Pour the batter into the pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester or wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack. In a small saucepan, heat the apricot preserves over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until melted, stirring constantly. Brush evenly over the cake (a basting brush works well). Serve warm or at room temperature. Garnish each serving with a dollop of the whipped topping. Beat the unheated apricot preserves with a fork. Fold into 3 cups frozen fat-free whipped topping, thawed in the refrigerator. Spread over the completely cooled cake. Refrigerate any leftovers. Pour the batter into two 12-cup muffin pans. Follow the baking times on the package. Brush with the warmed apricot preserves. Increase the amount of whipped topping to 1 1/2 cups. (serves 12, 1 cupcake per serving) An implement called a zester makes quick work of removing the peel, or zest, of citrus fruit. Use rather firm downward strokes, being careful to avoid cutting into any of the pith, the white bitter covering just beneath the peel. Measuring and cleanup will be easy if you work over a sheet of wax paper.

"Recipe Name: Maine Lobster Potpie. Ingredients: 1 recipe pate brisee/pie dough (recipe follows), 4 live maine lobsters (1 1/2 pounds each), 1 tablespoon sea salt, Ice bath, 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 cup brandy, 2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped, 2 cloves garlic, smashed, 1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped, 1 carrot, coarsely chopped, 1/2 bulb fennel, coarsely chopped, 1/4 cup tomato paste, 1 cup dry white wine, such as sauvignon blanc, 1 quart heavy cream, 3 sprigs fresh thyme, 1 bay leaf, preferably fresh, 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 1/2 pound assorted wild mushrooms, such as chanterelles and oyster, wiped of grit and halved if large, 2 large eggs beaten with 2 tablespoons water to make an egg wash, 12 white pearl onions, peeled and halved lengthwise, 8 baby carrots, green tops trimmed, halved lengthwise, 3 fingerling potatoes, sliced, 1/2 small green zucchini, sliced in half moons, 1/2 small yellow squash, sliced in half moons, 1/4 cup assorted chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, parsley, thyme, and chervil, 4 teaspoons white truffle oil (optional), 1 fresh truffle, sliced paper-thin (optional), 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted, plus more for dusting, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks, 4 to 6 tablespoons ice water, Instructions: Prepare and chill the pie dough as directed in the recipe. To cook the lobsters: place the lobsters in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to numb them. Fill a large srockpot three-quarters full with cold water and add the sea salt. Bring to a rapid boil over medium-high heat. Transfer the immobile lobsters to a cutting board. Working with 1 lobster at a time, and holding the lobster securely with a kitchen towel to protect your hands, insert the tip of a chefs knife at the base of the head, parallel to the body, and swiftly cut completely through the head between the antennas. Use a sideways twist to break the claws, knuckles, and tails off of the lobsters. Reserve the bodies for making the sauce. Place the claws and knuckles in the boiling water and boil for 1 minute. Add the lobster tails and continue to boil for an additional 4 minutes (the tails will be only cooked about halfway). Using a slotted spoon, transfer all the lobster pieces to the ice bath; let sit for at least 5 minutes to ensure the cooking process has stopped. To remove the meat from the claws, pull the thumb of the claws off and remove the inner cartilage. Lay the claws flat on a cutting board and carefully tap with the blade of a chefs knife to crack. Gently wiggle the meat out from the shell and place it in a large bowl. Using kitchen shears, cut open the knuckles and discard the shells. Add the lobster meat to the bowl. Lay the lobster tails on a cutting board, shell side up, and hold with a kitchen towel to steady. Using a serrated knife, make 3 cuts crosswise between the joints so that you have 4 sections, including the tail fan. Add the lobster pieces to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill until ready to use. The lobster may be prepared a day in advance. When cleaning the lobster bodies, it is best to wear kitchen gloves to protect your hands. Firmly pull the bodies and shells apart. When all of the bodies have been separated, use a tablespoon to scrape off the feathery gills and clean out the roe and innards from the underside of the shell. Coarsely chop the lobster shells and bodies. To make the sauce: Place a large stockpot over medium-high heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the oil. When the oil gets hazy, add the cleaned lobster shells and bodies. Cook, stirring often, until the shells are well seared and bright red, about 3 to 5 minutes. Shells equal flavor. To keep the alcohol from flaming, remove the pot from the heat and pour in the brandy. Carefully return the pot to the stove and cook until the brandy is almost totally evaporated. Push the shells to the sides of the pot and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the celery, garlic, onion, carrot, and fennel. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and begin to caramelize, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for about 2 minutes until the color deepens. Add the wine and stir to deglaze the pot, scraping up the bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking until all of the liquid is evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the cream, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, and coriander. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sauce turns light orange and tastes like lobster, 15 to 20 minutes. Pass the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean saucepan to remove the solids, using a spoon or spatula to press out all the juice. Place over medium heat and bring the lobster cream to a simmer. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a small saucepan, slowly melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over low heat. Just as the foam subsides, sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to cook the starchy taste out of the flour. Cook for 1 minute, without allowing the flour to color. Slowly whisk the roux into the lobster cream. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. The lobster cream should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat. Cover to keep warm. To prepare the filling: Place a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the butter and once it gets foamy, add the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and saute until the mushrooms release their moisture and begin to brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. Place an equal portion of the sauteed mushrooms, onions, carrots, potatoes, zucchini, and yellow squash evenly into each souffle dish. Remove the lobster meat from the refrigerator and place the equivalent of 1 whole lobster into each dish. Ladle 1/2 cup of the warm lobster cream sauce into each dish, sprinkle with the chopped herbs, a drizzle of truffle oil, and a few slices of black truffle. Preheat the oven to 425F. To assemble: remove the dough from the refrigerator and set it on the counter for 5 minutes to warm up and to make it easier to roll out. Sprinkle the counter and a rolling pin lightly with flour. Roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the dough into 4 circles, 1 inch larger than the diameter of the souffle dishes (you need four 1-quart dishes). Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the outer edges of the pastry circles with the egg wash. Carefully cap each dish with a pastry circle, egg wash side down, pressing the dough around the rim to form a tight seal. Brush the tops very lightly with egg wash and sprinkle with a little salt (preferably sea salt). Set the dishes on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, rotating halfway through cooking, until the potpie is puffed and golden. To serve: run a knife around the inside rims of the souffle dishes. Using a fork and spoon, carefully remove the dome cap and place it in the center of a serving plate. For a great presentation, arrange the pieces of lobster on top of the pastry, scatter the vegetables decoratively all around, and drizzle the lobster cream sauce over everything. Place the flour and salt in the food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter cubes, a few at a time, pulsing until the mixture looks like small peas. Slowly add the ice water, a little at a time, until the dough starts to come together without being too wet or sticky (you may not need all the water). Pinch a small amount together; if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour. The dough can be made 1 day in advance.","```cypher
