"Recipe Name: Boiling Information Recipe. Ingredients: How to boil water CATHERINE CORA: COOKING FROM THE HIP, Instructions: O Warm tips on wet way to cooking success This is the first of 10 columns by Cat Cora, the chef and partner of Postino in Lafayette. They are being written with Nicholas Boer. Boiling an oceans worth of water has drowned out all recollection of when I put my first pot on the stove. I do, however, remember Mom sitting me on the counter as she set out to cook spaghetti - my favorite dish, then and now. She would have, what seemed to me, the biggest pot in the world - steam rising and pasta swirling - it was mesmerizing. Mom would nab a string of spaghetti with tongs, blow on it and hand it to me. And I would throw it against the wall to see if it would stick. This was my introduction to the fine points of boiling water. Cooking from the hip -carefree and recipe free - is something I do every day as a chef. I can cook from the hip because I understand the cooking basics. and nothing is more fundamental than boiling water. I was taught as a young cook to put sufficient sea salt in my boiling water to make it \\""taste like the sea.\\ So now I wait till my water is boiling, I add in salt, and then taste it. I should feel like Im right on the beach. Cooks often ask me why I do not just salt the food instead of the water. If I did which, then the foods outsides would be salty and the insides would be sad and dull. By salting the water, the whole food gets seasoned, and the flavor stays in the food, not in the pot (the salty water keeps foods natural salts from leeching out). I boil so much water every day, which I do not even think about the simple but necessary steps which get me there. There are things to consider: decisions which become unconscious once youre cooking from the hip. The first decision is pot size. If youve only got one, then, well, this is a no-brainer. If youre cooking pasta, however, size is important: Noodles need plenty of room to swim. Crowding pasta into a small pot makes it impossible to cook the noodles al dente - (all DEN-tay) - meaning it has just the right tooth feel. The pasta will wade in slow-to-reheat water and turn gummy from the starchy liquid. For a lb. of pasta - sufficient for four - I start with at least 2 gallons of water, but the more the merrier. I like my water to come up just a few inches short of the pots top (if, after adding pasta to my boiling water, it starts to foam and overflow, I quickly add in a c. of cool water, and it calms right down). As for the water itself, I do not always start with warm tap water. I sneak up on potatoes and beans, for instance - putting them in the pot with cool water and then cranking up the heat. This would never work with pasta, but it cooks spuds and beans gently and proportionately. With our big pot of water, however, I am going to cook up a ridiculously easy pasta. This recipe is one of my fathers favorites: A steamy bowl of spaghetti with aromatic extra virgin olive oil, crushed chili flakes and parmesan cheese. Its so simple and so good. Im going to make an entire dish by only boiling water, but for most cooks - here and around the world - boiling water is just one method of many needed to get dinner on the table. Well look at most of those methods in future weeks. But for now, I have this huge pot on the stove and have my heat turned up to high. Getting gallons of water going is the first thing I do when Im cooking pasta. While its slowly coming to a boil, I start my cutting, grating and other pasta prep. But since this pasta is so easy, I just turn on the heat and go check my e-mail. I come back and notice the waters surface is beginning to ripple, telling me which the water will soon be at a simmer - the point where little air bubbles start breaking on the surface. Simmering is a good temperature for foods, such as artichokes, which take a long time to cook. If I were poaching pears, I would have sugar and spice in the water, and simmering is how I would cook them. If I had wine and herbs in my simmering water, I could poach some chicken or possibly fish fillets. In either case, I would never let the liquid come to a rolling boil- where water gurgles like a whirlpool - which would be too rough on delicate flesh. If Im not serving a poached food right away - as with salmon steaks served as a cool salad - I turn off the heat well before the fish is done and let it finish cooking by just sitting in the warm liquid, where it will absorb all the flavors from the herbs or possibly spices. I even store it in the liquid in the refrigerator. Letting food sit in the water, in that it has just boiled, is an easy way to make sure its cooked through without being overcooked. Try boiling large Large eggs for five min and then turning the water off. When the water has cooled, the Large eggs will be hard-cooked, but they will not have any gray around the yolks. And when cooked in salty water, the Large eggs shells come off easily. After all this jabbering, I look at my pot and see it is indeed looking like a steamy Jacuzzi. So I pour in sufficient sea salt to make the water cozy sufficient for a shark and, using a big spoon, actually taste the water to make sure it has just the right bite. Now, if I had some vegetables to cook, my water would be ready for blanching - when vegetables are given a short dip in boiling water. Blanching ripe tomatoes for just a few seconds, for instance, makes them easy to peel. And blanching is a great way to precook vegetables, such as carrots, asparagus and green beans. I just toss my trimmed beans into the boiling salted water and, with a skimmer, pull them out after just a couple of min. I often blanch several kinds of vegetables separately - cooking each slightly underdone - and reheat them together later. With blanching, the color stays vivid, and I can easily control the timing of my vegetables with my main course. Now which Ive got this outrageous pot of boiling water, I toss in a lb. of spaghetti (I like De Cecco; available at most supermarkets). I then stir the noodles with a super-long pair of tongs or possibly a giant spoon. Since, of course, the water will not come back to a boil if I watch it, I keep myself occupied by making sure I have all my pasta ingredients and tools at the ready. I put a colander in the sink for straining the pasta when its done. In a big, not-too-cool serving bowl, I measure - sort of - a c. of extra-virgin extra virgin olive oil, a c. of grated parmesan cheese and a big healthy pinch of crushed red chili flakes. Then I give my pasta another stir and go check my e-mail again. I do not linger too long, because I want my pasta to still have an al dente texture. Whichs what Mom and I were aiming for when I threw my noodle on the wall. So every once in a while, I pluck out a spaghetti strand and bite down. If my spaghetti is flabby, its too late. Luckily, our spaghetti still has a touch of chew. But it will be mush in a minute. I need to move quickly. This is the tricky part: straining a pot of steaming-warm water without getting a second-degree facial. I gather up two heavy towels and grab the pot by its handles (if there are no handles, turn off the heat and order pizza). I carefully bring the pot to the sink but stand to the side as much as possible (remember the facial). Then, letting the side of the pot lean on the front of the sink, I tip it over - and run. Just kidding. I do find the steam-bath agony is lessened, however, if I strain smoothly and rapidly. I do it all in one or possibly two pours. An alternative to straining is to use a skimmer to fetch out the pasta. This works OK for penne or possibly ravioli, but with squirmy noodles, it just takes too long. I often cook big batches of pasta ahead at the restaurant. Ill strain the noodles when they are still a bit hard; toss them lightly with extra virgin olive oil, and then spread them out on a sheet pan to cold. Later, when the dinner orders start flying in, I re-boil a bowls worth at a time for just a minute or possibly so. This is a good technique to try at home if youre serving guests and want to keep organized. Cooling off the pasta by tossing it in oil and spreading it out on a sheet pan keeps it al dente. If I were to cold the noodles down by running cool tap water over them, they would swell up a bit, like a sponge. For cooling blanched vegetables, its best to \\""shock\\"" them. This doesnt involve electricity; shocking means to plunge warm food into ice-cool water in order to bring all cooking to a halt. I use this method for delicate vegetables, such as fava beans, peas and ripe tomatoes. I let them refrigeratein the ice water for a minute or possibly two, then I transfer them to a cloth-covered sheet pan. For more sturdy veggies, like green beans, Ill just spread them out warm on a cloth-covered sheet pan. Because they are still \\""cooking\\"" I take them out of the pot a little sooner than if I were using an ice bath. OK, back to our strained spaghetti before it cools and turns into a sticky meatball. I transfer the steaming noodles to my bowl with the extra virgin olive oil, cheese and chili flakes. I add in some salt and fresh cracked black pepper. I mix it well with a pair of tongs. Then - the last thing I do before I serve any dish - I taste the pasta to make sure its perfect. With pasta, I just pick up a few strands with my fingers and slurp them down. Somehow, a glass of Pinot Grigio has made its way into my other hand (for fiery sauteing, that we will try our hand at next time, no drinking will be allowed till after the food is on the table). If I think my pasta needs more cheese, salt or possibly anything else, I add in it and toss the pasta again. Only when its just right do I call this dish by its true name: Spaghetti Spiro (after Dad). But you can call it whatever you want. Just shoot from the hip. BOIL TERMS Simmering: Water kept at a temperature where only small bubbles break the surface. Poaching: To cook food in simmering water. Rolling boil: A vigorous boil. Blanching: To briefly cook - from seconds to min - in boiling water. Shocking: To plunge blanched or possibly boiled food in ice water.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Chinese Dumplings (Jaozi). Ingredients: 13 cups Water Or Vegetable Juice, 1 cup Flour, 8 ounces, weight Ground Pork, 1 whole Egg White, 2 whole Scrambled Eggs, Finely Chopped, 1 ounce, fluid Dark Soy Sauce, 1/4 cups Fresh Ginger, Minced, 1/4 cups Shitake Mushrooms (Rehydrated), 1/4 cups Wood Ear Fungus (Rehydrated), 2 ounces, weight Glass Noodles (Rehydrated), 1/2 cups Scallions Or Chinese Leeks, Finely Chopped, 1/4 cups Fresh Green Herbs (Fennel, Parsley, Etc.) Finely Chopped, 1/4 teaspoons Salt, 1/4 cups Crumbled Tofu, 1/4 cups Carrots (minced Or Shredded), 1/4 cups Pepper Oil, 1 cup Malt Vinegar, 1 Tablespoon Sesame Oil, 1 teaspoon Hot Chili Pepper, Instructions: While I was in China, I learned a bit about Chinese cooking at a place called The Hutong. Its a very cool little Arts Center that focuses on culture, art, wellness, and much to my delight, cooking! My very first class at The Hutong was on Dumpling Making. Dumplings, as you may or may not know, kick ass. They are delicious little pockets of joy and can be made in countless varieties, including some very tasty vegetarian/vegan combinations. Ive made them since the class, most recently for my sister Heathers birthday dinner. Im no professional. In fact, my dumplings tend to look a little wonky. Sophia, my dumpling teacher, told me that Chinese people call dumplings like mine ass dumplings (since they look like doughy little derrieres). Well, they may look like hineys, but they taste like heaven. Thats what counts, right? By the way, these types of dumplings are called Jaozi (pronounced sort of like jow-zuh, but not quite). They are quite a bit like pot stickers or Japanese gyoza. So, without further ado, here is a crash course in dumpling making, ala me, based on what I learned at The Hutong. I wont repost their complete recipe, but I can give you a pretty in-depth rundown. If you have any questions, please let me know! Im happy to help. Fillings: When we arrived, our teacher, Sophia, had laid out a spread of ingredients in small white bowls. We were encouraged to sniff and taste each ingredient (expect the raw meat, of course) and learned a little about each one, and how it was prepped for inclusion in the dumplings. Pork: the raw pork was ground, like hamburger meat. Sophia told us that it is best to find pork that is heavily marbled with fat when making dumplings, as the fat is necessary for a smooth texture. Eggs: these were scrambled in a hot wok with a little salt and oil, then chopped finely. Tofu: Sophia used a very firm, but in all other regards, basic white tofu. It was crumbled, then stir fried in oil to reduce its moisture. Carrots: the carrots we used were minced in a juicer, but you can also use a food processor, or (heaven help you) a veggie peeler and knife to achieve the same, finely minced texture. Pepper oil: pepper oil is made by infusing dried flower peppers (red or green depending on personal taste) in oil. Sophia uses a plain soybean oil and red flower peppers and heats them over a low flame in her wok. You can strain the flower peppers out of the oil when it cools, or leave them in it for visual flair. But dont let them wind up inside your dumplings. That would not be so nice. Black wood fungus: also called wood ear fungus, these mushrooms are purchased dried and then reconstituted using room temperature salted water. The dried fungus looks like a black rose, but after it is hydrated, it looks more like a squashy pile of seaweed. Mince it finely after it is hydrated for use in dumplings. On a side note, according to Sophia, these mushrooms are used to cool the body and cleanse the digestive system in Chinese medicine. They can supposedly help with gall stones and other various digestive issues, but should be avoided if you are an overly chilly person. Dark soy sauce: a thick, dark, and intensely flavored soy sauce that is usually used on meats. This is used only with meat dumplings, as the flavor is too strong for veggies. Glass noodles: Sophia had a good time making us guess what these stiff, white noodles were made of. Our guesses included: rice, radish, and vermicelli, but were all totally wrong. These special noodles are made from green beans and peas. They become totally clear when cooked, and have a very unique, elastic-like texture. They should be boiled for 3-5 minutes, or until they become totally transparent, then drained, but not rinsed. When they cool enough to handle them, chop them into little, 1/2 centimeter bits. Ginger: we used fresh, finely diced ginger, but Sophia assured us that you can also use dried ginger or crystallized ginger according to your taste. An interesting note, the preparation of ginger, as well as the part of the ginger root used, affects is purpose when it comes to Chinese medicine. Shiitake mushrooms: in China, these little brown mushrooms are readily available both fresh and dried. According to Sophia, the dried mushrooms have a better flavor for dumplings, so we used the dried kind. These are hydrated the same way the black wood fungus is in room temperature salt water. Scallions (Chinese leeks): in China they have these enormous scallions, which they call either chives or scallions in English. I am not sure, but I think they might actually be closer to leeks. They use them constantly in Chinese cuisine. For dumplings, they chop them very finely. You can also use regular old scallions if you prefer. Mystery greens: there is a very dark green leaf that is minced and added very commonly to dumplings in Beijing. Our teacher, Sophia, called it dill at first, but after we all smelled it we decided it definitely could not be dill. She used the word fennel next, but Im still not 100% percent sure it was fennel. It had a slightly herbaceous, lemony aroma, but has a texture similar to spinach once its cooked. Up until the class, I had assumed it was spinach or the dark leafed baby Chinese cabbage that I saw everywhere I went. The Fillings: To make veggie dumpling filling, you simply mix and match any non-meat fillings you like, then top them off with some pepper oil and a little salt. (Tip: dark soy sauce isnt very good in veggie dumplings, AND if you are not a vegan, you may want to add a little egg white and whip the mixture up to make it a little more firm.) For meat dumplings, the process is a wee bit more standardized. First, stir in a few teaspoons of dark soy sauce into the meat, followed by the minced scallions, and some salt. Crack an egg white into the mix and stir (in only one direction) until the egg whites whip up and get the mixture nice and sticky. Once the mixture has gotten nice and firm, you can add your mystery greens and some pepper oil. Add more salt and soy sauce to taste, and maybe a little ginger if the mood strikes you. The dough is very basic, just flour and water, kneaded into a soft, but not sticky ball. Mix at a ratio of about 1 cup flour to 1/3 cup water or juice. You may need to adjust that a wee bit though. After you finish kneading the dough, set it aside covered with a bowl or in a lidded dish for about 10 minutes. You can enhance the nutritional value of the dough (as well as the appearance) by using vegetable juice in place of water. We used carrot juice and spinach juice, but there are countless other juices that could be used as well. Beet juice, for instance, would create lovely purple dumplings. Once the dumpling dough is ready, it is rolled into a tube that measures a little less than an inch in diameter. The tube is then chopped into 1-inch nuggets and dusted with dry flour. We rounded the nuggets, then flattened them into discs using the palms of our hands. You could probably use a cup or a mallet to get more perfect discs, but Im not sure thats really necessary. The tricky part comes next. Youll need to flour your work surface, and get yourself a very small rolling pin. Pinch one edge of your disc, then roll firmly into the center on three sides, (rotating each time). Continue to roll the pin in very deep on each turn until you get your disc to be about 3 inches or so wide. The goal is to make the inside of the disc thicker than the outside, so that the bit that holds the filling is strong, and the excess dumpling isnt too chewy. This took some practice, and for later inspiration, I took a short video of Sophia rolling her dough like an expert. You can check that out here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/drstrangeglove/4114672492/in/set-72157623146977041/ Another slightly tricky part, filling and folding the dumplings is a delicate art. To a perfectionist, this activity could be maddening, but if you simply want to get that sucker closed, its not so hard. Lay the wrapper flat in your palm, then use your other hand to scoop the filling into the middle. Not too much, not too little. Pinch the middle of the wrapper closed first, then carefully pinch one of the edges together, and fold the remaining opening in the same direction that you folded the edge. Repeat on the other side, and viola! Your little joazi is ready to go. Cooking the Jaozi: After we had a platter full of dumplings which ranged in beauty from flawless to lumpy and weird (sexy ass dumplings, as Sophia says), we boiled ourselves a wok fill of water and dumped those suckers in! This part excited me, can you tell? I love boiling things in woks. The steam! The danger! Its really pretty thrilling. Anyway, we boiled them until, and I quote, they sink to the bottom, then rise to the top, then sink to the bottom again, then rise again, then sink and rise once more. Another clue to tell that they had finished cooking was to look at their shape. Dumplings puff up while they cook, and when theyve finished they shrink up like Saran wrap. You can also poke at the meat ones a bit to see how firm they are. We also pan fried some, which were really really delicious. To pan fry the dumplings, you heat oil in a wok, then place the raw dumplings in the pan, standing on their little dumpling bottoms. Let them cook for a bit, until they become golden down below, then add a generous portion of water, and cover the pan. Youll know they are finished based on the aforementioned Saran wrap and poke tests, but you cannot, unfortunately rely on the sink and rise test this time. Dipping: Jaozi are meant to be dipped! They are most commonly, if not always, served with malt vinegar. Most folks toss some hot chili pepper and sesame oil into the mix (myself included). And some people even like to add a little plain soy sauce to the equation. Any way you dip them though, they should be pretty ding dang tasty.","```cypher

Ingredients: 13 large eggs, 5 1/2 cups sugar, 2 2/3 cups vegetable oil, 2 2/3 cups part-skim ricotta cheese (about 21 ounces), 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup grated lemon peel (from about 8 lemons), 3 tablespoons orange liqueur, 2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, 8 3/4 cups all purpose flour, 2 tablespoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, 5 large eggs, 1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, room temperature, 1 1/4 cups sugar, 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 5 lemons), 1 tablespoon grated lemon peel, 3 cups chilled whipping cream, 6 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 cups water, 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 8-inch-diameter cardboard cake round, 3 1/2 cups fresh raspberries, about three 6-ounce baskets, 3 1/2 cups fresh small blackberries or boysenberries, about three 6-ounce baskets, 1 12-inch-diameter cardboard cake round, 11 large egg yolks, 3 1/4 cups plus 7 tablespoons sugar, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk (do not use low-fat or nonfat), 1 1/2 tablespoons grated lemon peel, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, 3 pounds unsalted butter, cut into large pieces, room temperature, 3/4 cup water, 7 large egg whites, 3 12-inch-long, 1/4-inch-diameter wooden dowels, 1 3-foot long peach and/or cream colored ribbons, 2 4-foot-long peach and/or cream-colored ribbons, Assorted nonpoisonous flowers (such as roses, freesias, and tulips), Instructions: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350F. Butter bottom of 12-inch-diameter cheesecake pan(not springform) with 3-inch-high sides and removable bottom. Line bottom of pans with parchment paper. Beat eggs, sugar, and oil in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer and medium-low speed 5 minutes. Increase speed to medium and beat until mixture is very thick and falls in heavy ribbon when beater is lifted, about 5 minutes. Whisk cheese, orange juice, lemon peel, liqueur, lemon juice, and vanilla in medium bowl until well blended. Add cheese mixture to egg mixture; beat at low speed until just blended. Transfer to extra-large bowl (at least 6-quart capacity). Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into large bowl. Sift dry ingredients over batter in 5 additions, whisking to blend after each addition. Transfer about 11 cups batter to 12-inch prepared pan and about 5 cups batter to 8-inch prepared pan (batter should be of equal depth in both pans). Bake cakes until golden brown in firm (tops may crack) and tester inserted into center comes out clean, rotating pans occasionally for even baking and covering loosely with foil if browning too quickly; about 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer to racks; cool completely. Whisk eggs to blend in medium bowl. Combine butter, 1 1/4 cups sugar, lemon juice, and peel in heavy medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until butter melts, sugar dissolves and mixture comes to a boil. Gradually whisk lemon mixture into eggs. Return to same pan. Stir over medium heat until curd thickens and just begins to bubble, about 3 minutes. Strain curd into large bowl. Chill until cold and thick, stirring occasionally, about 4 hours. Beat cream and 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until firm peaks form. Fold into curd in 4 additions. Chill filling until very cold, about 2 hours. Stir all ingredients in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; bring to boil. Chill syrup until cold, about 1 hour. (Cakes, filling, and syrup can be made 1 day ahead. Cover cakes; store at room temperature. Cover filling and syrup; keep refrigerated. Cut around sides of cakes to loosen. Push up pan bottoms, releasing cakes from pan. If necessary, cut between parchment and pan bottoms to loosen cakes. Invert cakes onto surface. Peel off parchment. Wash and dry pans and reassemble. Using long serrated knife, cut off doomed top of 8-inch cake to level. Cut cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Place bottom cake layer, cut side up, on 8-inch cardboard. Place cake on cardboard back into pan. Brush bottom layer with 1/4 cup lemon syrup. Spread with 1 1/2 cups lemon filling. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups raspberries. Place top cake layer atop raspberries; press cake lightly to compact. Brush with 1/4 cup syrup. (Assembled cake may be higher than pan sides.) Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Using long serrated knife, cut off doomed top of 12-inch cake to level. Cut cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Place bottom layer, cut side up, on 12-inch cardboard. Place cake on cardboard back into pan. Brush with 1/2 cup lemon syrup. Spread with 3 cups lemon filling. Sprinkle with 2 cups raspberries. Using 10- or 11-inch diameter tart pan as aid, slide top layer onto raspberries. Press cake lightly to compact. Brush with 1/2 cup syrup. (Assembled cake may be higher than pan sides.) Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate both cakes overnight. Whisk yolks and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in large bowl to blend. Bring milk and lemon peel just to boil in heavy large saucepan. Gradually whisk hot milk into yolk mixture. Return to same saucepan. Stir custard over medium heat until thick, about 3 minutes ( do not allow custard to boil). Strain custard into extra-large (6-quart) metal bowl; add vanilla extract. Using handheld electric mixer, beat custard until custard lightens and custard cools to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Gradually add butter; beat until well blended, scraping down sides of bowl often. (If buttercream appears curdled at any time, place bowl directly over heat for several seconds. Remove from heat and beat well; repeat warming and beating as necessary to achieve smooth texture). Set buttercream aside at room temperature. Stir 2 1/4 cups sugar and 3/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Attach clip-on candy thermometer to side of pan. Increase heat and boil syrup without stirring until thermometer registers 240F, occasionally brushing down sugar crystals from sides of pan with wet pastry brush, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, beat egg whites in large bowl of heavy-duty mixer until stiff but not dry. Gradually add 5 tablespoons sugar and beat until firm glossy peaks form. Gradually beat hot sugar syrup into egg whites. Continue to beat 2 minutes longer. Place bowl of meringue into larger bowl filled with ice and water. Using handheld electric mixer with clean beaters, continue to beat until meringue cools to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Gradually add meringue to buttercream, beating until well blended. Cut around all sides of 8-inch cake. Push up pan bottom, releasing cake from pan. Remove pan bottom, leaving cake on cardboard base. If desired, place cake on revolving cake stand. Using offset spatula, spread thin layer of frosting (about 2 1/3 cups) over top and sides of cake to anchor crumbs. Refrigerate cakes on their cardboard bases until frosting is firm, about 1 hour. Spread enough frosting (about 1 1/2 cups) over top and sides of 8-inch cake to coat. Spread enough frosting (about 3 cups) over tops and sides of 12-inch cake to coat. Dip large offset spatula into very hot water to warm blade; wipe dry. Run spatula over sides and tops of cakes, warming spatula repeatedly as necessary, until frosting is smooth. Using pastry bag fitted with small plain round tip, pipe border of small frosting dots around top edge of each cake. Refrigerate both cakes uncovered on their cardboard bases until frosting hardens, about 4 hours. (Once frosting is hardened, cakes can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated up to two days or double-wrapped with plastic and frozen up to two weeks. Before continuing with recipe, thaw wrapped frozen cakes overnight in refrigerator.) Insert 1 dowel straight down into center of 12-inch cake to cardboard base. Mark dowel about 1/4 inch above top of frosting. Remove dowel and cut with serrated knife at marked point. Cut 2 more dowels to same length. Press 3 cut dowels into cake, positioning about 3 1/2 inches inward from cake on platter. Using large metal spatula as aid, place 8-inch cake on its cardboard atop dowels in 12-inch cake, centering carefully. Wrap 3-foot long ribbons around base of 8-inch cake; cut to fit with slight overlap. Press ribbons gently into frosting to adhere. Wrap 4-foot long ribbons around base of 12 inch cake; cut to fit with slight overlap. Press ribbons gently into frosting to adhere. Transfer 8-inch cake to work surface; cut cake into 16 slices. Remove dowels from 12-inch cake. Staring 2 inches inward from edge and inserting knife straight down, cut 8-inch-diameter circle in center of cake. Cut outer portion of cake into 16 slices. Cut middle portion of cake into 8 slices. Cut inner 4-inch portion of cake into 4 wedges. Serve cake.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Crispy Tart with Fresh Fruit. Ingredients: Approximately 2 pounds classic puff pastry, recipe follows (or frozen), Pastry cream, flavored, recipe follows, 3/4 cup light corn syrup, 1/4 cup water, 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered, Assorted fresh fruit, sliced, Confectioners sugar, for dusting, Suggested presentation: Sugar cage, recipe follows, 4 cups unbleached flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled, 1/4 cup water, 1 1/4 cups butter, cold, 3 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 egg yolks, 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 vanilla bean, 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 2/3 cup light corn syrup, 1/2 cup water, Cooking spray, Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture. Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled. Using a pastry brush, coat one side of each cooled circle with the tempered chocolate and allow the chocolate to set at room temperature, about 5 minutes. This layer of chocolate keeps the tarts from getting soggy. When the chocolate has set, spread about 2 tablespoons of pastry cream on each tart shell on top the chocolate coating. Cover with assorted sliced fresh fruit. It looks best to arrange the fruit in a sunburst pattern, fanning each type of fruit from the center of the circle toward the edge. Sprinkle the tops of the tarts with powdered sugar right before you serve them. A great finish for this dessert is a sugar cage over the top. For the Classic Puff Pastry: Place the flour, salt, melted butter, and most of the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax. Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton. The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it two more single folds, starting each time with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Make four indentations in the dough with your fingertips representing the four folds. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. For the Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to add it. Cut the butter into small chunks and stir it in until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use Flavor the cream according to your taste. For example, with a whisk or spatula, slowly fold about 1 tablespoon of any flavored liqueur into the cream at any point in the recipe, tasting often. If you add too much, the cream will become runny and lose its shape. If you prefer to add flavor without alcohol, place the zest of 1 orange in the heating milk to infuse the flavor into the pastry cream. Store the pastry cream well wrapped in the refrigerator until ready to use. Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 311 degrees F, or what is known as the \\""hard crack\\"" stage. Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-sized, microwave-able glass bowl. Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly coat with cooking spray a clean, dry bowl that matches the diameter of whatever youre placing the sugar cage over. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl, making sure to come all the way to the rim, however, not so thick that you cant see the bowl through the sugar. Using a sharp chefs knife, slice the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To unmold the cage, place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl; you will be able to see the cage release from the inside of the bowl. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside of the bowl. Once the cage has released from the bowl, carefully lift it out and place it over the dessert. If the sugar is still too warm, the cage may begin to collapse. A good idea is to release the cage from the bowl but leave it in the bowl until it has cooled completely. This will ensure that it keeps its shape. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for one to two days.) Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolates residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Roast Turkey and Pan Sauce. Ingredients: 1 fresh turkey, 12 to 14 pounds, including neck and giblets, 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks, 2 large onions, peeled and chopped into 1-inch pieces, 3/4 pound celery stalks with leaves, rinsed and cut into 2-inch chunks, 1 ounce dried porcini slices, crumbled into 1/2-inch pieces, 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, 6 short branches fresh rosemary, with plenty of needles, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, if needed, 4 to 6 cups Turkey Broth (page 80) or Simple Vegetable Broth (page 288), 1/4 cup Reduced Balsamic Vinegar, glaze consistency (page 39), Turkey Gravy, Quince, Cranberry, and Apple Sauce (page 367), Cotognata (page 368), Reduced Balsamic Vinegar (page 39), A heavy-duty roasting pan, at least 12 inches by 18 inches, preferably larger, A flat wire roasting rack, big enough to hold the turkey but small enough to leave space for vegetables on the pan bottom, Wide heavy-duty aluminum foil, A saucepan, a medium-mesh sieve, and a potato masher, to make the sauce, A kitchen brush, for painting the turkey with glaze (optional), 8 large eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 cups fine dry bread crumbs, 2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano, 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated, Zest of 1 small orange, finely grated, 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley, 1/3 cup golden raisins, 1/3 cup dried apricots, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces, 1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted, 1/3 cup cooked chestnuts (page 71), chopped into bits (optional), 3 to 4 quarts Turkey Broth (page 80) or broth of Poached Chicken (page 328), heated to boiling in stockpot, Instructions: Arrange a rack low in the oven, making sure that the fully prepared turkey will fit in easily and roast well below the oven ceiling. Remember that the foil tent will be an inch or two higher than the turkey itself. Preheat the oven to 375. Take out the giblets and neck from the turkey, and save. Remove and discard any lumps of fat from the cavities. Rinse the bird inside and out, in cool running water, clearing the cavity of any residue. Rinse the giblets too. Pat everything dry with paper towels. Set the wire roasting rack in the pan and the turkey on the rack, with the neck and giblets on the pan bottom. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt inside the main turkey cavity and the rest of the salt (1 1/2 tablespoons in all) over the outside of the bird. Pour the olive oil on the turkey, a bit at a time, and spread it with your hands to coat the entire skin, including the back. Twist the tip joint of each wing down, and forcefully fold it so it stays in place under the neck (think of placing both your hands behind your neck). Rest the oiled turkey on the rack, flat on its back, wings folded and breast up. Toss together in a bowl the vegetables and seasonings, except the salt and broth, with the 1/4 cup olive oil, mixing everything well. If you are using my turkey broth or other salted broth, dont add salt. If using an unsalted stock, mix 1 teaspoon kosher salt with the vegetables. Put a handful or two of mixed vegetables (and one of the rosemary branches) loosely into the cavity of the turkey. Spread all the rest in one layer on the pan bottom, all around the turkey. Push the vegetable pieces under the rack if your pan is small, so they will cook in the stock. Before pouring in the broth, move your pan near the oven, so you wont have far to carry it. Pour the broth into the roasting pan on the side, without wetting the turkey. Depending on pan size, youll need 4 to 6 cups of stock to fill the bottom about 1/3 inch deep. Add more stock (or water) if necessary. Tear two long sheets of aluminum foil. Cover one side of the pan with the first sheet, arching it well above the turkey. Crimp the foil against the rim of the pan so it stays in place without touching the bird. Cover the rest of the pan and turkey with the second sheet of foil (or more if needed), overlapping the sheets several inches. Press the bottom of the foil tightly against the sides of the pan, all around, sealing the tent completely. Carefully place the covered pan on the oven rackit will be heavy, so you may need some help. Push it well to the back of the oven for the maximum heat, and let the turkey roast undisturbed for 2 hours. Open the oven, pull the roasting pan to the front, and lift off the foil sheets. The pan juices should be bubbling away, and the steaming turkey will be mostly pale. With a ladle or bulb baster, baste the turkey all over with the pan juices and return it to the oven. Save the foil. Roast the turkey uncovered for 30 minutes to an hour, to brown the skin and cook the meat to a safe internal temperature. (Because every oven thermostat is different and turkeys will vary in size, cooking times will vary.) After 30 minutes, baste again and check the internal temperature of the turkey (see below), then continue roasting, if necessary, until the meat reaches the right temperature. If the breast is getting too dark, cover it loosely with a sheet of foil. Carefully remove the roasting pan and lift the turkey out of the pan and onto a baking sheet or platter. Cover the turkey loosely with the foil, and keep it in a warm place while you make the sauce. (The oven should remain on at 375 if youre going to glaze it.) Remove the turkey neck but not the giblets (nor the liver) from the roasting pan and put into the saucepan. With a potato masher, crush the cooked vegetables and giblets in the roasting juices, breaking them up into little bits. Set the sieve on the saucepan, and pour everything out of the roaster into the sieve, scraping up all the juices, vegetables, the liver, and flavorful caramelized bits. Press the vegetables and other solids against the sieve with a big spoon to release their liquid, then discard whats left in the sieve. You should have 1 to 2 quarts of pan juices (depending on how much stock you started with and the roasting time). Set the saucepan over high heat, bring the juices to a boil, and let them reduce, uncovered. To make a glaze for turkey, if you like, mix 1/4 cup of balsamic-vinegar reduction and 2 tablespoons of the pan sauce until spreadable; heat and thin it as needed. Put the turkey, still on the rack, back in the empty roasting pan. Brush the glaze all over the bird in a smooth, even coat. Return the turkey to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the glazed skin is crisp, shiny, and deeply colored. Let it rest in a warm place, tented with foil, if you wish. To finish the sauce: Pour into the boiling sauce any turkey juices that accumulated on the baking sheet. When the sauce has reduced almost by half, taste it for salt and add a bit more if you like, and bring back to a simmer. Strain it once again, this time through a fine-meshed sieve into a measuring cup or other narrow container. Let it rest for a minute, then spoon off the fat layer thats accumulated on top. Thicken the sauce with bread crumbs if its too liquid. To serve: for formal occasions, you can present the whole turkey and carve it at the table. For most family dinners, I cut the bird up in the kitchen as follows. Cut the wings off, slice the breast meat, then remove the legs at the joint and slice the leg and thigh meat from the bones for dark-meat lovers; arrange all the pieces on a serving platter. Pour any juices left in the pan or on the cutting board over the meat, then nap all the pieces with a cup or more of the finished sauce. Bring the platter to the table, and let people serve themselves. Put the rest of the sauce in a bowl and pass it. To make the dough, whisk the eggs in a large mixing bowl, add the salt, and then whisk in the bread crumbs. Stirring with a wooden spoon, incorporate all the remaining ingredients except broth; when the dough gets too stiff to stir, work it with your hands. Its ready when it holds together, although it will still be slightly sticky. Shape the dough into a cylindrical loaf about 8 inches long and 4 inches thick. Cut a 40-inch length of cheesecloth and fold it lengthwise so its 18 inches wide. Set the loaf at one narrow end of the band, centered, with a margin of cloth on either side. Roll up the loaf in the cheesecloth, so it is wrapped in many layers. Twist the open sides of the cloth in opposite directions, tightening them against the loaf like a piece of candy in a twisted wrapper. Tie the twists on both sides with long pieces of kitchen twine so they cant unravel. Leave at least a foot or so of twine dangling from each knot. Now lower the gnoccho grande into a stockpot of boiling turkey brothyou should have enough to cover the gnoccho by 1 inch. It can be cooked in a pot of salted water like pasta, but it will be a bit less flavorful, although still good. Tie the free ends of twine to the pot handles or to a big spoon lying on the pot rim, so the gnoccho is suspended in the broth and cant fall to the bottom. Bring the broth back to a gentle boil, and poach the loaf for 40 minutes or so, then lift it out of the broth and into a bowl (the broth may, of course, be used again). Untie the twine, and roll the loaf out of the cheesecloth. Slice into the center to check that the dough is cooked all the way throughuncooked dough will be wet and mushy. If necessary, rewrap the gnoccho and cook it a bit longer. You can slice and serve cooked gnoccho grande right away, or let it cool, wrap and refrigerate it, and reheat the slices in a pan of broth. As an accompaniment to roast turkey or other main courses, slice in 1/2-inch-thick rounds, then in half-rounds or wedges, and serve on a warm platter. Gnoccho grande also makes a lovely soup garnish: cut the rounds into small cubes and heat them in broth. The reduced sauce from the roasting pan juices will be fully flavored but sometimes thinner than a typical turkey gravy. Heres how I thicken the juices and give them more texture (without using flour or starch). Put the strained and reduced sauce in a pan or skillet, set over medium heat, and whisk in fine dry bread crumbsabout 1 teaspoon for each cup of sauce. Keep whisking as the sauce starts to bubble; let it cook and thicken for a minute. Youll have a delicious and natural-tasting gravy in no time. Strain and serve. When is the turkey roasted enough? After 2 1/2 hours total of roasting, insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh (the part that cooks most slowly). A reading of 165 to 170 will indicate that the thighs are almost done, and you can remove the bird from the oven, make the sauce, and complete the glazing. If the temperature is lower (likely with a bigger turkey), continue roasting and check again in 15 minutes. If you dont have a thermometer, check the juices that flow from the thigh when you pierce it near the joint. Any sign of pink in the juices indicates that more roasting is needed. When you read this recipeor the ones for roast pork, lamb shoulder, or stuffed veal breast later in this chapteryoull see that my way of roasting involves more than sticking a piece of meat in a hot oven. In all these recipes, the ingredients list calls for lots of cut-up vegetables, seasonings, and a quart or more of broth. All the vegetables and liquid go into the roasting pan, underneath the meat, and I seal everything in a tent of aluminum foil for the first hour or two in the oven. This wet cooking serves to break down and soften the fibers in the meat and vegetables. As the fibers loosen, they release their flavors. And as the liquid boils and steams within the closed environment, it permeates the meat with all the flavors it has picked up. The second stage, dry cooking, begins when the tent is removed and the meat is exposed to the direct dry heat of the oven This uncovered cooking produces the crispy and caramelized exterior that is essential in a roast. When you simply roast meat, as most recipes suggest, you get the caramelization but not the tenderizing of the meat fibers and the development and exchange of flavor. And, often, I find that dry heat alone toughens the fibers; lean meat, like the breast of poultry, will quickly dry out. I roast chicken exactly as I do turkey, with a few small differences: the oven temperature is higher; the vegetables, which are cut smaller, cook with the pan juices on the stove top so they soften up. For a 3 1/2-to-4-pound chicken: Heat the oven to 425. Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons oil. Use a third to a half of the vegetables and seasonings given for turkey; chop them all into 1/4-inch pieces. Add a pint of broth to the pan, and enough water to fill the pan to about 1/3 inch deep. Seal the chicken in a foil tent over the pan, and roast it covered for 1 hour. Remove the foil, and scrape all the vegetables and liquid into a saucepan togetherdont strain the vegetables as you do with turkeyand cook over high heat. To finish the chicken, return it to the oven and roast 20 to 30 minutes uncovered, checking it occasionally and basting with the juices in the saucepan, until the skin is crisp and golden. To finish the sauce, reduce the pan juices by half, strain out the soft vegetables, and puree them through a sieve into the sauce.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: St. Honore. Ingredients: 4 cups unbleached flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled, 1/4 cup water, 1 1/4 cups butter, cold, 3 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1 tablespoon water, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar, 4 egg yolks, 2 cups whole milk, 1 vanilla bean, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional, 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, 1 1/4 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cubed, 1 1/4 cups bread flour, 5 to 6 eggs, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup light corn syrup, 1/2 cup water, Whipped cream, add at your discretion (and love of whipped cream), Instructions: For the Classic Puff Pastry: Place the flour, salt, melted butter, and most of the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax. Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton. The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it the final two folds, starting each time with the 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour before using. Then it will be ready to be rolled and formed into the shape required. The finished puff pastry will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for one day or in freezer for up to two months. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture. Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled. For the Chocolate Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to do so. Add the bittersweet chocolate and stir until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of it to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use. For the Pate a Choux: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the water, salt, sugar, and butter into a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the bread flour all at once, and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spatula. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, move the paste from side to side in the saucepan with the wooden spoon. Turn it over onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, allowing it to dry, however, keeping it moving all the while or it will burn. You will know the paste is dry enough when it begins to leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. This will prevent the eggs from cooking and scrambling when combined with the paste. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs one at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated, which is okay. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth and homogenous again. The number of eggs you will wind up using will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 4 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about one foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes about 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in one big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. If necessary, add one more egg. If the pate a choux is too dry, it will not pipe well. If it is too wet, it will be loose and runny, and wont hold its shape. Place the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch straight tip. Pipe the batter into 1 1/2-inch mounds on a parchment lined sheetpan about 1 1/2 inches apart as they will spread slightly when baked. Using the same plate as a guide from the puff pastry, trace a ring onto a piece of parchment paper. Flip the paper over and pipe a ring of choux batter along the line that is about 1 1/2 inches wide. Bake the choux for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden brown and dry on the inside, about 15 minutes more. To help the choux dry, you can open the oven door during the last 5 minutes of baking to let out the steam. For the Caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until light golden brown. When the desired color is reached, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-size glass bowl. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown, whereas a glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. To assemble the St. Honore, divide the chocolate pastry cream in half. Reserving a small amount of whipped cream for decoration, mix the rest with one half of the pastry cream creating a lightened version. Dab the bottom of the choux ring with the caramel and set on the puff pastry circle. Cut 4 puffs in half and using caramel, glue the puff bottoms to the top of the ring, spacing them equally. Dip the tops of the puffs in caramel and set aside. Pipe the chocolate pastry cream into a mound in the center of the ring. Using a star tip, cover the mound with lightened chocolate pastry cream in straight lines, starting at the center and moving outward. Pipe the lightened chocolate pastry cream into each puff bottom. Place the puff tops on the filled puff bottoms. Place one more caramel-dipped puff at the top of the dessert. Decorate with whipped cream by making rosettes or trails of whipped cream from top to bottom.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: 25 + household tips. Ingredients: 1 read and follow directions! :), Instructions: 1. Take your bananas apart when you get home from the store. If you leave them connected at the stem, they ripen faster. 2. Store your opened chunks of cheese in aluminum foil. It will stay fresh much longer and not mold! 3. Peppers with 3 bumps on the bottom are sweeter and better for eating. Peppers with 4 bumps on the bottom are firmer and better for cooking. 4. Add a teaspoon of water when frying ground beef. It will help pull the grease away from the meat while cooking. 5. To really make scrambled eggs or omelets rich add a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream, cream cheese, or heavy cream in and then beat them up. 6. For a cool brownie treat, make brownies as directed. Melt Andes mints in double broiler and pour over warm brownies. Let set for a wonderful minty frosting. 7. Add garlic immediately to a recipe if you want a light taste of garlic and at the end of the recipe if your want a stronger taste of garlic. 8. Leftover snickers bars from Halloween make a delicious dessert. Simply chop them up with the food chopper. Peel, core and slice a few apples. Place them in a baking dish and sprinkle the chopped candy bars over the apples. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes!!! Serve alone or with vanilla ice cream. 9. Reheat Pizza Heat up leftover pizza in a nonstick skillet on top of the stove, set heat to med-low and heat till warm. This keeps the crust crispy. No soggy micro pizza. I saw this on the cooking channel and it really works. 10. Easy Deviled Eggs Put cooked egg yolks in a zip lock bag. Seal, mash till they are all broken up. Add remainder of ingredients, reseal, keep mashing it up mixing thoroughly, cut the tip of the baggy, squeeze mixture into egg. Just throw bag away when done easy clean up. 11. Expanding Frosting When you buy a container of cake frosting from the store, whip it with your mixer for a few minutes. You can double it in size. You get to frost more cake/cupcakes with the same amount. You also eat less sugar and calories per serving. 12. Reheating refrigerated bread To warm biscuits, pancakes, or muffins that were refrigerated, place them in a microwave with a cup of water. The increased moisture will keep the food moist and help it reheat faster. 13. Newspaper weeds away Start putting in your plants, work the nutrients in your soil. Wet newspapers, put layers around the plants overlapping as you go. Cover with mulch and forget about weeds. Weeds will get through some gardening plastic they will not get through wet newspapers. 14. Broken Glass Use a wet cotton ball or Q-tip to pick up the small shards of glass you cant see easily. 15. No More Mosquitoes Place a dryer sheet in your pocket. It will keep the mosquitoes away. 16. Squirrel Away! To keep squirrels from eating your plants, sprinkle your plants with cayenne pepper. The cayenne pepper doesnt hurt the plant and the squirrels wont come near it. 17. Flexible vacuum To get something out of a heat register or under the fridge add an empty paper towel roll or empty gift wrap roll to your vacuum. It can be bent or flattened to get in narrow openings. 18. Reducing Static Cling Pin a small safety pin to the seam of your slip and you will not have a clingy skirt or dress. Same thing works with slacks that cling when wearing panty hose. Place pin in seam of slacks and ... guess what! ... static is gone. 19. Measuring Cups Before you pour sticky substances into a measuring cup, fill with hot water. Dump out the hot water, but dont dry cup. Next, add your ingredient, such as peanut butter, and watch how easily it comes right out. (Or spray the measuring cup or spoon with Pam before using) 20. Foggy Windshield? Hate foggy windshields? Buy a chalkboard eraser and keep it in the glove box of your car When the windows fog, rub with the eraser! Works better than a cloth! 20. shaving cream can leaving rust ring? apply a few coats of nail polish to the bottom ring of the can.. no more rust rings! 22. Conditioner Use your hair conditioner to shave your legs. Its cheaper than shaving cream and leaves your legs really smooth. Its also a great way to use up the conditioner you bought but didnt like when you tried it in your hair. 23. Goodbye Fruit Flies To get rid of pesky fruit flies, take a small glass, fill it 1/2 way with Apple Cider Vinegar and 2 drops of dish washing liquid ( do NOT add any more than 2 drops) ; mix well. You will find those flies drawn to the cup and gone forever! 24. Get Rid of Ants Put small piles of cornmeal where you see ants. They eat it, take it home, cant digest it so it kills them. It may take a week or so, especially if it rains, but it works and you dont have the worry about pets or small children being harmed! 25. Dryer Filter Even if you are very diligent about cleaning the lint filter in your dryer it still may be causing you a problem. If you use dryer sheets a waxy build up could be accumulating on the filter causing your dryer to over heat. The solution to this is to clean your filter with with a toothbrush and hot soapy water every 6 months. To help get rid of fruit flies.. 1) grab an empty 16oz., 1 liter or 2 liter bottle. 2) cut the top off about a few inches below the nozzle. 3) invert what u just cut off. 4) tape all edges with clear tape so there are no holes. 5) pour a few inches of apple cider vinegar in bottom. 6) set on counter where fruit flies are seen most. The fruit flies love apple cider vinegar and will be drawn to it, get inside bottle and be trapped. Just toss when done. TO GET DRIED UP GREASE SPLATTER OFF ENAMEL: in a bowl place 1 cup baking soda. Pour peroxide(the kind u use for cuts) a little at a time into baking soda until it forms a paste. (Stirring with additions) slather paste onto grease spots and using a rougher rag or a softer scrubby gently rub the area and it comes right off with minimal scrubbing. ( i got a mixer that was covered in it, it cleaned the entire machine in under 10 min. And it was bad! Now it looks brand new! Also works for some tub and sink stains too) My cousin posted most on fb. The others ive added.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: ALCACHOFAS Y SETAS COCA Recipe. Ingredients: 16 oz Coca dough, 8 oz Truffled Manchego Bechamel, 4 oz Marinated Grilled Chanterelles, 8 oz Manchego Cheese, 3 month, grated, 2 oz 1 year aged Manchego cheese, small block, 8 oz Marinated Confit Artichokes, 2 oz Micro Parsley, 1 ea.Lemon, for zesting, Instructions: For the Coca Dough: 1 lb. pizza flour 1 lb all-purpose flour 1 A 1/4 tsp. active dry yeast 2 A 1/4 tsp. kosher salt 1 tsp. sugar A 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1 A 3/4 cup water, warm 1 tsp. honey In a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook, bloom the yeast with the warm water and honey for 5 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix on medium speed for 5 minutes. Rest 2-3 hours and let double. Form the dough into 2 oz balls and hold chilled. You will have much more dough than you need, it can be frozen and used at a later time. For the Truffled Manchego Bechamel: 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour 2 tbsp. unsalted butter 2 cups milk 1 A 1/2 cups manchego, 3 month, grated 2 tbsp. kosher salt A 1/4 cup white truffle oil A 1/4 tsp lemon juice In a medium sauce pan over low heat, melt the butter until foamy. Add the flour and mix to create a roux. Continue to cook over low heat for one minute. Turn the heat up to medium and whisk in 2 cups of the milk. Bring the milk and flour mixture up to a simmer while whisking vigorously to prevent any lumps from forming. When the milk is thickened, turn heat to low and cook for 30 minutes. Add the grated manchego and whisk into the bAchamel until melted and smooth. Do not place the mixture back onto the heat or you will cook the manchego and the sauce will become gritty. Whisk in the truffle oil, salt and lemon juice and hold warm until ready to use. For the Marinated Grilled Chanterelles: A 1/4 lb. chanterelle mushrooms, brushed clean 3 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp. kosher salt 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper 1 tbsp. chopped Italian parsley 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced finely Preheat a flat griddle or grill. Mix the oil, pepper, parsley and garlic together in a bowl. Toss the mushrooms with the salt and add to the marinade. Let mushrooms marinate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours. When ready to cook the mushrooms, turn the griddle or grill to high heat and place the mushrooms in an even layer on the cooking surface. Cook for two minutes, or until mushrooms are wilted and have been lightly caramelized. Remove and refrigerate until ready to use. For the Marinated Confit Artichokes: 3 ea. large artichokes, outer leaves removed, stems peeled 4 cups Olive oil 1 cup extra virgin olive oil 5 ea. garlic cloves 10 sprigs fresh thyme 1 sprig fresh rosemary 1 tbsp. kosher salt 1 tbsp. black truffle peelings, minced 1 tsp. kosher salt A 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper 1 tsp. lemon juice 1 tbsp. white truffle oil Preheat oven to 300o F. Season artichokes with 1 tbsp. salt and place artichokes in an oven proof saucepot large enough to hold them in an even layer, stem side up. Cover with the olive oils and add herbs and garlic. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place pan in the oven and cook for 30 minutes. Check the center of the artichoke with a paring knife, there should be no resistance. If chokes are not done, place back in the oven and continue to check every 5 minutes until they are done. Remove chokes from the oil and cool on a rack. When cool, slice artichoke in half lengthwise through the stem and using a spoon, scoop out the tough choke and any remaining outer leaves. Slice artichoke hearts into A 1/4a slices and toss with the black truffle peelings, remaining kosher salt, pepper, lemon juice and truffle oil. Refrigerate until ready to use. To Assemble the dish: 8 ea. coca dough balls, rolled into 10a x 4a x 1/8a shapes, and poked with a fork 1 cup manchego cheese, 3 month grated 1 ea. block of 1 year aged manchego 1 ea. lemon for zesting 2 oz. micro parsley 1 tsp. arbequina olive oil Preheat oven with a pizza stone in it to 500o F. Lay coca doughs flat in front of you in a large work surface. On each dough, spread 1 oz of truffled manchego bAchamel in an even layer. On top of the bAchamel, sprinkle the grated manchego evenly over each coca. On top of the cheese, spread the grilled chanterelles in an even layer on each coca. Place the cocas in the oven on the pizza stone and cook for 2 minutes, or until the cheese begins to brown slightly and the bottom is crisp. Carefully remove the cocas with a spatula back to the work surface and spread the marinated artichokes evenly over each coca. Shave the 1 year aged manchego over the cocas using a vegetable peeler, and slice each coca into 4 pieces. Grate lemon zest over each coca using a Microplane or cheese grater. Finish on top with a generous amount of micro parsley tossed in arbequina olive oil. Serve.","```cypher

Combine the \\""B\\"" ingredients in a separate container, and mix well. Adjust the water temperature depending on the room temperature. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and mix with a spatula until no longer floury. * Repeat the motions of cutting and folding by scraping and pulling the dough from the bottom of the bowl. Once the dough reaches the state shown in Step 3 (about 70% combined), use your hands to mix into a ball until the flour is almost completely incorporated. For those who are able, use a spatula to gather the dough without using your hands. Cover the bowl in plastic wrap or with a shower cap to prevent the dough from drying out, and let it sit for 30 minutes at 20-27C. After 30 minutes, bring the base of the dough over the top and fold four times, each in different directions. I use both my hands and a spatula for this step. Bring the dough together, cover in plastic wrap and let it sit for another 30 minutes at 20-27C. I changed bowls for the sake of clarity, but you may use the same bowl. After 30 minutes, stretch and fold (punch down) the dough twice, rotating the dough 90 degrees after the first round, then the dough together. Repeat Steps 8-9 a total of 2-3 times. After letting the dough rest, punch it down, then knead. Depending on the consistency of the dough, repeat Steps 8-9. While it depends on your desired texture, unlike regular bread dough, ideally, the dough for pain rustique should tear apart when pulled apart at a distance. After kneading the dough, return it to the bowl, then cover it with plastic wrap or a shower cap. While preventing the dough from drying out, allow it to rise either in the refrigerator or in a temperature up to 25C, as you prefer. If youre in a hurry, place it in the oven on the bread-rising setting at 30C. Rising proportions: 3 times with natural leaven (Hoshino), 2.5 times with dry yeast I mark the height so that I can easily judge the height. Rising time: 12 hours or more in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator (depending on the temperature and amount of yeast) 3 hours or more at room temperature (depending on the room temperature and type of yeast) Adjust the rising situation and amount of dry yeast to suit your lifestyle, climate, and desired bread texture. Of course, the longer you allow it to rise, the deeper and more delicious the taste. While its a given that bread made with the natural leaven is tasty, dough made with 0.3 g of dry yeast and risen in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator is very tasty, too. While the bread is rising, prepare the caramelized walnuts. They are easy to make and super delicious even eaten as-is. They are versatile and can also be preserved. The recipe gives an easy-to-make amount, so I recommend using the amounts given. With cool dough risen in the refrigerator, remove it when it has risen 80-90 % to desired size, allowing it to finish rising at room temperature. While the bread is rising, prepare a bakers couche (canvas cloth) by dusting it with all-purpose flour. Particularly for very moist dough. Once the dough is finished rising, use a bench scraper to gently transfer it to the prepared couche. * The dough that was at the bottom of the bowl should now be on top. Cover to prevent it from drying, then allow it to rest for 30 minutes. If the temperature is too warm, then set it in the refrigerator for this step. After 30 minutes, stretch the dough into a rectangular sheet about 15 x 25 cm. Do this gently, by lightly pulling on the four corners. With the heel of your palm, flatten the dough; do not press out the trapped air (only gently and evenly distribute any large bubbles). Place desired amount of the caramelized walnuts along the center of the dough. The walnuts should be placed in clusters to be distributed among the desired amount of finished pain rustique loaves. For even distribution, place a cluster in the center, then a cluster at each end, then place a cluster between the center and end clusters on each side. Note: If the caramelized walnuts are exposed on the surface of the dough, they may burn and become bitter. Although it takes some effort, carefully place the walnuts as shown in Steps 29 and 30 to prevent them from spilling out of the center. The photo shows how they should not look. Referring to Step 18, fold the front 1/3 of the dough over the center. *Take care not to press out the air. *Do not press down on the dough more than necessary. On top of the folded portion of dough, place a smaller portion of the caramelized walnuts, distributed in the same way as in Steps 29 and 30. Fold the remaining 1/3 of the dough over the top of the walnuts. In effect, wrapping the caramelized walnuts in the dough by folding it into thirds. Coat a bench scraper with oil or flour, then divide the dough into 5 equal loaves. * If the seam on the top looks untidy, gently flip them over. Place the loaves into a bakers couche with plenty of space in between. To make sure the loaves dont lose shape, gather the edges of the canvas to make walls for the pockets. Gather the edges of the canvas and secure them with a clip or similar device. For those who dont have a bakers couche or canvas cloth, arrange the loaves on a sheet of parchment paper instead. The photo in Step 45 shows how the dough looks after baking them on a sheet of parchment paper. Allow the dough to rise a second time to 1.5 times in size around 30C. -- While Steps 37 and 38 instruct to allow 5 loaves to rise, because of my particular my baking conditions, I separated the dough into two loaves. To explain, my oven has areas that tend to burn, making it necessary to shift the loaves around while baking, which brings down the oven temperature; that is why I made two loaves instead of five. Normally, I would divide the dough in Step 24, let it rest at a different temperatures to adjust the time, but this time, I changed the temperature of the rising time to adjust the time. If youre baking conditions are not particular, such as mine, 5 loaves should fit on a single baking tray of a normal oven. While waiting for the final proofing, melt the butter. This is a browned butter that I keep a stock of in my freezer. Once the second proofing is over, gently place the loaves on parchment paper. The dough is very soft, so I recommend using a bench scraper coated in flour. Sprinkle all-purpose flour over the loaves, then slash the tops once or twice. Since the loaves are as soft as marshmallows, they may be hard to slash, so I recommend dampening your knife and quickly sliding it through. For this recipe, I grip the blade of the knife between my pointer finger and thumb, and slash the tops about 3 mm deep. The photo shows the blade I use. Brush the slashed opening with melted butter, then sprinkle on the granulated sugar. I recommend using a generous amount of sugar. Before baking, spritz the entire loaf (except for the slashed opening) with water. For those with a steam-oven function, spritz lightly. Place the parchment paper on a heat-proof board or thick piece of cardboard. It should be a slippery surface to use to slide the parchment paper into the oven. Preheat the oven with the baking tray inside on the maximum temperature setting. Reduce it to 230C, then slide the loaves onto the baking tray while still placed on the parchment paper. Quickly spritz the loaves inside the oven several times, then bake for 15-20 minutes and theyre done. The baking time and temperature may vary depending on the oven. For steam-oven baking, bake it on the steam-oven setting for 5-10 minutes. After that, bake it without the steam-oven setting for the remaining baking time. -- I lay pie stones at the bottom of my oven (TOSHIBA-ER-A9) with an oven thermometer. Turn off the oven, then place a pizza stone (mine is DeLonghi) and pie stones on a baking tray to set in the center rack. This is set-up is particular to my oven, which has horizontal air-flow. If your oven has vertical air-flow as shown, do not use this method. While letting the loaves rest in Step 25, preheat the oven to 250C on hot-air mode. After preheating, set it on regular baking mode. Since my oven is old, this is the timing I use for preheating to achieve an oven temperature of about 230C when the loaves are ready to bake. Place the loaves on the pizza stone with an oven temperature of 230C (in my case, with an oven setting of 250C), pour water over the pie stones in front of the pizza stone to steam-bake. Quickly close the oven door, then let it sit for 3 1/2 minutes without turning on the oven to open up the slashed tops and allow the steam to evenly distribute. After 3 1/2 minutes, pour 70 ml boiling water over the pie stones on the bottom rack to steam-bake. Turn on the oven. Step 65 should be done very quickly. The oven temperature should now be 180C. Bake it at 250C for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 230C and remove the parchment paper. After baking for 5 more minutes, they are done. For those who have the same model oven as mine, try this method using a DeLonghi pizza stone. If the slashed tops do not open, or the dough doesnt rise while baking, try using the steam-baking techniques I listed in Steps 63 and 64. The sugar tops are nice and crispy with a buttery aroma Biting into the crunchy cinnamon-scented caramelized walnuts is truly delightful. Enjoy the combination of the fluffy and chewy dough with a subtle cinnamon scent and the crispy crust. Even with an old oven, beginners at baking hard bread, like me, can bake a nice pain rustique with a shiny gluten film and various sized air bubbles. Even with a high water content, you dont need any experience in bread making to succeed. Give it a try, even if its your first time. I recommend snacking on the cinnamon-scented caramelized walnuts as-is. Here is a my recipe for \\""The Ultimate Walnut Caramel Pound Cake\\"" using Cinnamon-Scented Caramelized Walnuts.
