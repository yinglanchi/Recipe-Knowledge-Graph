"Recipe Name: Ricotta Gnocchi. Ingredients: 1 pound fresh ricotta cheese (see recipe below), 1 egg, 1 ounce grated parmesan, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, Flour, to roll gnocchi, Serving suggestion: melted butter, peas and sage or a lean pasta topping of your choice, such as tomato sauce with basil and a shaving or two of parmesan cheese., 2 quarts milk, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, Instructions: In a large bowl, whip the ricotta to break up the curds. Add the egg and stir until evenly combined. Add the grated cheese and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasonings. Pour flour onto a large plate or shallow pie dish. As if you were making chocolate chip cookies, use a teaspoon to form oval shape gnocchi and drop into flour. Do not let the formed gnocchi touch each other or theyll stick together. Working in batches of six, coat gnocchi lightly with flour by rolling the plate. Dust flour off gnocchi and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Repeat. Refrigerate two hours or until gnocchi are firm. You can refrigerate overnight but fresh gnocchi is best eaten the day its prepared. Drop gnocchi into salted boiling water. Adjust heat to a simmer. When gnocchi floats to the top and is slightly firm to the touch, about 3-4 minutes. Remove using a slotted spoon. Serving suggestion: melted butter, peas and sage or a lean pasta topping of your choice, such as tomato sauce with basil and a shaving or two of parmesan cheese. In a heavy-bottomed pot, slowly bring the milk and the lemon juice to 200 degrees F. Remove from heat and cover. Place in a spot where the temperature will remain uniform (we suggest an unheated oven). After 6 hours, strain the curds and whey through cheesecloth. Tie the corners of the cloth to form a bag and hang it to drain overnight.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Grilled Quesadillas W/ Avocado. Ingredients: 2 poblano chiles, roasted, 23 cup manchego cheese, grated, 12 cup panela cheese, crumbled, 3 tablespoons Cotija cheese, grated, fresh ground black pepper, to taste, 1 avocado, peeled and sliced about 3/8-inch thick, 1 tablespoon fresh limes or 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, to taste, 4 (10 inch) flour tortillas, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 cup salsa fresca, Instructions: Peel chiles, remove stem, seed and tough membranes. Slice thinly. Mix cheeses together with black pepper and set aside. Brush each slice of California Avocado on both sides with juice and oil; lightly sprinkle with salt. Grill, turning once, until lightly browned with grill marks; reserve. Lay tortillas on a clean work surface. Divide cheese among the tortillas, placing just on one half of each tortilla. On top of cheese evenly distribute the poblano strips and grilled avocado slices. Drizzle each quesadilla with 1 tablespoons salsa, if desired. Melt butter in a large frying pan. Brown quesadilla on both sides over medium heat. Cover pan for a minute or so to finish melting cheese. Cut each quesadilla into 4 pieces. Serve 2 pieces per serving with remaining salsa on the side. --------------------------. To roast the chiles hold them over an open flame or roast at 425 degrees F in the oven until the skin is blistered on all sides. Immediately place in a paper bag, roll the top down and allow chiles to steam for a few minutes. Then, when cool enough to handle, peel off the outer skin. *Large avocados are recommended for this recipe. A large avocado averages about 8 ounces. If using smaller or larger size avocados adjust the quantity accordingly.","```cypher

When the water comes to a boil, add the brown rice and lentils, and place the cover on the pot. Reduce the heat to simmer and let cook until all the water is absorbed. While the rice and lentils are cooking, wash and peel the carrots, potato, onion, and garlic. We use our food processor to finely shred the veggies, but a hand grater can also be used. If using a food processor, the garlic and chipotle peppers can be chopped in it, too. When the brown rice and lentils have absorbed all the water, remove from the stovetop and empty the pot contents into a large mixing bowl. Add the tomato paste and thoroughly mash the ingredients together with a potato masher. Add the shredded and chopped veggies and continue mashing the ingredients together. Add a little of the chick pea flour and oat flour or quick oats and continue mashing."", (We grind our own chick pea flour and oat flour together in the dry container of our Vita-Mix. (Do not use cooked chick peas or the burgers will be too soft.) Chick pea flour can be purchased in a health food store. ). Continue to add more of the flour in 1/4 to 1/2 cup portions until all of the ingredients are thoroughly mashed and blended together. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly dust the surface of a large baking pan with corn meal. Form the veggie burger mix into the desired size using a mixing spoon and a smaller spoon, or by forming them in your hands. Place the veggie burgers on the baking sheet and flatten to the desired thickness, making sure that the burgers stay circular. Place the baking pan in the oven and bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, if you like the outsides of the burgers slightly crispy, or for a shorter time if you want the surface of the burgers to remain softer. When the burgers are baked to the desired consistency, remove from the oven and enjoy. We freeze the leftover burgers in individual plastic sandwich bags for enjoying at another time. It takes about 1 minute in a microwave oven at \\""high\\"" to heat a frozen burger (plastic bag removed) for a sandwich.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Frozen Espresso Cheesecake. Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups finely ground chocolate wafer cookies (8 ounces; about 35 cookies), 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 4 large egg yolks, room temperature, 4 1/2 teaspoons good-quality instant espresso powder (such as Medaglia dOro), Pinch of salt, 1 1/2 pounds mascarpone cheese, room temperature, 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 12 ounces hard torrone (Italian nougat), cut into 1/4-inch pieces, 1/2 cup heavy cream, chilled, Instructions: Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, and 3 tablespoons sugar in a medium bowl; set aside. Put the egg yolks, 1/4 cup sugar, the espresso, and salt in the heatproof bowl of an electric mixer. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water; whisk until thick, about 2 minutes. Transfer the bowl to an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Stir in the mascarpone and vanilla by hand until smooth. Stir in the torrone; set aside. Beat the cream with the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in a clean mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream with a rubber spatula into mascarpone mixture. Refrigerate. Line a 10 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap and parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides. Pour one-third of the mascarpone mixture into the lined pan; even the layer with an offset spatula. Evenly top with half of the crumb mixture; press the crumbs gently. Repeat to make a second layer of mascarpone mixture and crumbs. Top with the remaining mascarpone mixture. Loosely fold over the parchment and plastic wrap. Freeze at least 3 hours, or overnight. To serve, let the cake stand at room temperature 10 minutes. Set the loaf pan in a larger pan; pour cold water into the pan to reach three-quarters up the sides of the loaf pan. Let stand 10 seconds. Holding the parchment, lift out the cake. Invert onto a plate; peel off the plastic and parchment. Let stand 10 minutes more before serving.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Grape Tartlets with Almond Crust. Ingredients: 1/4 cup almonds slivered, blanched, 1 1/2 cups flour, all-purpose, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 3 tablespoons brown sugar firmly packed, 1/2 cup butter cold, unsalted, cut into small pieces, 1 large eggs cold, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest freshly grated, 3/4 cup apricot preserves (jam), 3 tablespoons sherry, 3/4 pound grapes, seedless preferably an assortment of 23 colors, halved & if necessary, seeded, 1/4 cup almonds slivered, lightly toasted, Instructions: Finely grind almonds in a food processor with on/off motion, or crush with a rolling pin until as finely ground as possible. Add flour, salt and brown sugar to processor and blend, or combine ground almonds, flour, salt and brown sugar in a bowl and stir to blend. Add butter and process or work with the fingertips until mixture reassembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl beat egg lightly. Stir in the vanilla and lemon zest. With a processor on, add egg mixture to dough through feed tube and process until dough forms. Pat dough into ball, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide into 8 equal parts. Press each piece into a lightly buttered 3 to 3 1/2 inch tartlet pan, preferably with removable rim, patting into an even layer. (The dough will soften as you work with it.) Chill tartlet shells in freezer for at least 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 400F (200C). Remove tartlet shells from freezer, line each with a square of foil, and fill with pie weights or dried beans to prevent dough from puffing during baking. Bake on baking sheet in center of oven for 10 minutes. Remove foil with weights, reduce oven temperature to 350F, and continue baking for 15 to 20 minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown. Let tartlet shells cool in pans and place on wire racks to cool completely. To prevent glaze, combine preserves and sherry in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring, until preserves are melted. Strain through a sieve. To assemble tarts, brush tarts on the bottom of each tartlet shell. Arrange grapes, cut sides down, in a decorative pattern, alternating colors, in the bottom of each pastry shell. Brush remaining glaze, reheating it if necessary, over grapes and edges of tartlets. Sprinkle toasted almonds over tartlets before glaze sets. Serve at room temperature.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Pasta Alfredo. Ingredients: 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 onion, chopped, 2 (12 ounce) cans fat-free evaporated milk, 2 teaspoons dried basil, 12 teaspoon nutmeg, 12 teaspoon black pepper, 1 lb frozen broccoli florets, 1 lb whole wheat pasta, linguine or 1 lb fettuccine, 1 cup grated asiago cheese, 1 lb boneless skinless chicken tenders, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too), 1 lb cooked peeled shrimp, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too), 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 12 ounces sliced mushrooms, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 garlic clove, minced or pressed through garlic press (bottled works well, too), asiago cheese, grated, red pepper flakes, sliced green onion, Instructions: I find it best if preparing in this order: Cook chicken and pasta at the same time. Cook mushrooms and sauce at the same time, finish by preparing the shrimp. Prepare chicken in a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and garlic. Over medium-high, heat until oil & garlic sizzle. Be careful not burn garlic or it may taste bitter. Add chicken tenders and saute on both sides until browned and firm, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove chicken; keep warm until ready to serve. Prepare linguini or fettuccine according to package directions. After thorough draining, return to original cooking pot, and cover to keep warm. Prepare the sauce in a large non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until softened. Add the milk, basil, nutmeg, pepper, and broccoli. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook on low. Check after 3 minutes to see if broccoli is tender. You may need to simmer for an additional 2 minutes- take care when regulating heat to prevent scalding the milk. Prepare mushrooms in the same skillet used to cook chicken. Over medium-high, heat until oil & garlic sizzle. Add mushrooms and saute, tossing frequently until tender and lightly browned. Remove from heat and keep warm until ready to serve. Prepare the shrimp, while the sauce and mushrooms are cooking, in a large non-stick skillet with olive oil and garlic. Over medium-high, heat until oil & garlic sizzle. Quickly add shrimp and saute for 2 minute (shrimp is already cooked; you are only heating it through). Remove from heat and sprinkle evenly with lemon juice. Top pasta, by alternating sauce and cheese, while tossing to coat. You may arrange the chicken, shrimp, and mushrooms in warmed bowls, allowing your guests to choose their favorite; or incorporate all ingredients together. Sprinkle with additional grated Asiago cheese. Sliced green onion is a nice garnish; a nice flavor medley when paired with this sauce. For the daring, dust this dish with red pepper flakes (hint: test first because a little goes along way).","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Cute Teddy Bear Cookies (Gluten-Free). Ingredients: 150 grams Rice flour (Joshinko), 50 grams Almond flour, 100 grams Butter (unsalted), 60 grams Powdered sugar (or caster sugar), 5 grams or more Cocoa (unsweetened), 1 large egg, 1 tsp Baking powder, 1/2 tsp Baking soda, 1 Vanilla essence, Instructions: Bring the butter to room temperature. Sift the dry ingredients (or you can omit this). Beat the egg. Put the butter in a bowl, and cream it with a whisk. (If the butter is too hard, microwave for about 15 seconds.) Add the powdered sugar to Step 2, and mix until it turns white. (Its ok if its roughly mixed together.) Once mixed together, add the egg, and mix further. The mixture may separate to start with, but it will blend together as you keep mixing. Add the dry ingredients into Step 4, and fold in gently using a rubber spatula. To make white dough and brown dough, divide the dough into 90% and 10%. Add the cocoa to the bigger batch. Take out 10% of the cocoa dough and add more cocoa to make dark brown dough. (For eyes and nose.) Wrap the dough with cling film and let it rest for more than 30 minutes in the fridge. Start preheating the oven to 180C before you start shaping the teddy bears. Take out the dough from the fridge, and shape it into teddy bears face as you like. The photo shows the parts I made for my teddy bear cookies. Bake at 180C for 10-12 minutes. The cooking time differs depending on your oven, so adjust accordingly. Once they are baked, place on a cooling rack, and cool them a little. Then theyre done! If you have leftover white dough, why not make koalas or pandas with it? I made other kinds of animals as well. The bunny was the easiest.","```cypher
