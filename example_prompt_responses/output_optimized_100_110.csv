"Recipe Name: St. Honore. Ingredients: 4 cups unbleached flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled, 1/4 cup water, 1 1/4 cups butter, cold, 3 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1 tablespoon water, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar, 4 egg yolks, 2 cups whole milk, 1 vanilla bean, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional, 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, 1 1/4 cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cubed, 1 1/4 cups bread flour, 5 to 6 eggs, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup light corn syrup, 1/2 cup water, Whipped cream, add at your discretion (and love of whipped cream), Instructions: For the Classic Puff Pastry: Place the flour, salt, melted butter, and most of the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax. Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton. The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it the final two folds, starting each time with the 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour before using. Then it will be ready to be rolled and formed into the shape required. The finished puff pastry will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for one day or in freezer for up to two months. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture. Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled. For the Chocolate Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to do so. Add the bittersweet chocolate and stir until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of it to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use. For the Pate a Choux: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the water, salt, sugar, and butter into a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the bread flour all at once, and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spatula. Return the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, move the paste from side to side in the saucepan with the wooden spoon. Turn it over onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, allowing it to dry, however, keeping it moving all the while or it will burn. You will know the paste is dry enough when it begins to leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan. Remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. This will prevent the eggs from cooking and scrambling when combined with the paste. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs one at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated, which is okay. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth and homogenous again. The number of eggs you will wind up using will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 4 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about one foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes about 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in one big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. If necessary, add one more egg. If the pate a choux is too dry, it will not pipe well. If it is too wet, it will be loose and runny, and wont hold its shape. Place the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch straight tip. Pipe the batter into 1 1/2-inch mounds on a parchment lined sheetpan about 1 1/2 inches apart as they will spread slightly when baked. Using the same plate as a guide from the puff pastry, trace a ring onto a piece of parchment paper. Flip the paper over and pipe a ring of choux batter along the line that is about 1 1/2 inches wide. Bake the choux for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden brown and dry on the inside, about 15 minutes more. To help the choux dry, you can open the oven door during the last 5 minutes of baking to let out the steam. For the Caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until light golden brown. When the desired color is reached, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-size glass bowl. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown, whereas a glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. To assemble the St. Honore, divide the chocolate pastry cream in half. Reserving a small amount of whipped cream for decoration, mix the rest with one half of the pastry cream creating a lightened version. Dab the bottom of the choux ring with the caramel and set on the puff pastry circle. Cut 4 puffs in half and using caramel, glue the puff bottoms to the top of the ring, spacing them equally. Dip the tops of the puffs in caramel and set aside. Pipe the chocolate pastry cream into a mound in the center of the ring. Using a star tip, cover the mound with lightened chocolate pastry cream in straight lines, starting at the center and moving outward. Pipe the lightened chocolate pastry cream into each puff bottom. Place the puff tops on the filled puff bottoms. Place one more caramel-dipped puff at the top of the dessert. Decorate with whipped cream by making rosettes or trails of whipped cream from top to bottom.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Tiramisu Wedding Cake with Mixed Berries. Ingredients: 7 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour, 3 tablespoons baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, 2 3/4 cups (5 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, 5 2/3 cups sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons almond extract, 3 3/4 cups whole milk (do not use low-fat or nonfat), 18 large egg whites (about 2 1/3 cups), room temperature, 2 cups Kahlua or other coffee liqueur, 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder or coffee powder, 14 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature, 7 cups powdered sugar, 2 1/3 cups chilled whipping cream, 7 tablespoons sweet Marsala, 3 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract, 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped, 1 6-inch-diameter cardboard cake round, 1 9-inch-diameter cardboard cake round, 1 12-inch-diameter cardboard cake round, 1 11-inch-diameter revolving cake stand (optional), 9 12-inch-long, 1/4-inch-diameter wood dowels, 4 1/2 cups assorted berries (such as raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries), Fresh mint sprigs, 12 cups mixed berries (such as raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and hulled, quartered strawberries), 6 tablespoons sugar, Instructions: Position racks in top and bottom thirds of oven and preheat to 350F. Butter one 12-inch-diameter cake pan with 3-inch-high sides, one 9-inch-diameter cake pan with 3-inch-high sides and one 6-inch-diameter cake pan with 3-inch-high sides. * Line bottoms with parchment. Sift flour, baking powder and salt into medium bowl. Using handheld electric mixer, beat butter in 12-quart bowl on medium-high speed until light. Gradually add sugar and beat until well blended. Beat in extracts. On medium-low speed, beat in dry ingredients alternately with milk in 3 additions each, beating just until combined (batter will be thick). Using electric mixer fitted with clean dry beaters, beat whites in another large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/3 of whites into batter to lighten. Fold in remaining whites. Spoon batter into prepared pans so that depth of batter is the same in each pan; smooth tops. Bake until tops are deep golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 55 minutes for 6-inch cake, about 1 hour 5 minutes for 9-inch cake and about 1 hour 20 minutes for 12-inch cake. Cool cakes in pans on racks 20 minutes. Run knife around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn out cakes onto racks and peel off parchment. Cool cakes completely. Mix all ingredients in heavy large saucepan. Boil over medium-high heat until mixture is reduced to 2 2/3 cups, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cool syrup completely. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until light. Gradually add sugar and beat until fluffy. Add cream, Marsala and vanilla and beat until well blended. Cover and let stand at room temperature up to 1 hour. Finely grind chopped chocolate in processor (do not overprocess or chocolate will clump together). Using serrated knife, cut each cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Spread dab of frosting on 6-inch cardboard round; top with bottom layer of 6-inch cake, cut side up. Brush cake with 2 tablespoons syrup. Spread 1/2 cup frosting over. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons ground chocolate. Top with middle 6-inch cake layer. Brush with 2 tablespoons syrup.

"Recipe Name: Pugliese. Ingredients: 2 cups (10.8 ounces) biga (page 107), 2 1/4 cups (10 ounces) fancy or extra fancy durum flour and unbleached bread flour, in any combination (such as a 50-50 blend), 1 1/2 teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt, 1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast, 1/4 cup (2 ounces) mashed potatoes (optional), 1 to 1 1/8 cups (8 to 9 ounces) water, lukewarm (90 to 100F), Semolina flour or cornmeal for dusting, Instructions: Remove the biga from the refrigerator 1 hour before making the dough. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or a serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill. Stir together the flour, salt, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the biga pieces, mashed potatoes, and 1 cup of the water. (If you are using all bread flour instead of durum, start with 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water.) Using a large metal spoon (or on low speed with the paddle attachment), mix until the ingredients form a wet, sticky ball. If there is still some loose flour, add the additional water as needed and continue to mix. If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand (see page 56). Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using an electric mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or for as long as it takes to create a smooth, sticky dough. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is still very sticky against the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in a little more flour (either type) until it clears the sides. Dont be alarmed if the dough seems very sticky. The wetter it is, the better the final bread will be. Sprinkle enough bread flour on the counter to make a bed about 8 inches square. Using a scraper or spatula dipped in water, transfer the dough to the bed of flour and proceed with the stretch-and-fold method shown on page 138. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil, again dust with flour, and loosely cover with plastic wrap or a food-grade plastic bag. Let rest for 30 minutes. Repeat the stretch-and-fold method and again mist with spray oil, dust with flour, and cover. (Each time you repeat this process, the dough will become stronger, more elastic, and less sticky.) Lightly oil a large mixing bowl. For the third time, repeat the stretch-and-fold technique. With a spatula dipped in water, transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment the dough at room temperature for 2 hours, undisturbed. Generously dust the counter with flour. Remove the plastic wrap and, with hands and a bowl scraper dipped in flour, transfer the dough to the counter, taking care not to degas the dough any more than necessary. With a metal pastry scraper that has been dipped into flour, or a serrated knife dusted with flour, divide the dough into 2 pieces. Again dipping your hands into flour, gently shape the dough pieces into 2 boules, as shown on page 72. Let them relax, seam-side down, on the counter for a few minutes while you prepare the proofing bowls. Prepare 2 proofing bowls as shown on page 36, making sure to coat with spray oil and generously dust the entire surface of the cloth with flour. Gently transfer the dough, seam side up, into each of the bowls. If the seam opens up, pinch it closed. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the bowls with the flaps of the cloth. Proof at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the dough has expanded to about 1 1/2 times its original size. Prepare the oven for hearth baking as described on pages 9194, making sure to have an empty steam pan in place. Preheat the oven to 500F. Generously dust a peel or the back of a sheet pan with semolina flour or cornmeal, and gently transfer the dough to the peel or pan by carefully turning each bowl over onto the peel, lifting off the bowl, and then carefully peeling off the cloth. The dough will spread out on the peel or pan. With a sharp razor blade or French lame, score the loaves with a pound (#) sign. Transfer the dough to the baking stone (or bake on the sheet pan). Pour 1 cup hot water into the steam pan and close the door. After 30 seconds, spray the oven walls with water and close the door again. Repeat twice more at 30-second intervals. After the final spray, lower the oven setting to 450F and bake for 15 minutes. Check the loaves at this point and rotate 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Continue baking for 5 to 15 minutes, or until the breads are a deep golden brown and register about 205F in the center. Remove the loaves from the oven and transfer them to a cooling rack. The crusts will soften somewhat as they cool. Allow the loaves to cool for at least 40 minutes before slicing or serving. Lean, rustic dough; indirect method; commercial yeast Day 1: 2 1/2 to 4 hours biga Day 2: 1 hour to de-chill biga; 7 minutes mixing; 4 1/2 to 5 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 15 to 30 minutes baking If you do not have fancy durum flour, you can substitute semolina flour, but use only one-third as much as the formula calls for and replace the rest with an equal amount of either unbleached high-gluten or bread flour. You can also make this without any durum or semolina by using only high-gluten or bread flour. This dough is yeasted and also boosted by a biga pre-ferment, but you can make a wild-yeast, mixed-method version by replacing the biga with an equal amount of firm sourdough starter (page 233). Because it is so wet, this dough is well-suited to mixing in a food processor. Follow the food processor instructions on page 55. Another ingredient that shows up in some versions of pugliese is mashed potato. A small amount adds a nice flavor and tenderizes the bread because of the potato starch. In this formula it is an optional ingredient; if you use it, you may have to increase the flour to compensate for the added moisture. Be sure to use mashed potatoes that have already been seasoned with salt, such as those left over from dinner. The amount of water in the final dough will be determined greatly by the particular type and brand of flour you choose. Durum flour, in any form, tends to absorb more water than bread flour, so use the amount below only as a guideline and starting point. Be prepared to adjust as the dough demands. This dough also makes exceptional pizza dough or focaccia. See pages 162 and 211 for instructions on shaping it for these applications. Along with grissini (breadsticks), bruschetta, or sliced, toasted, and topped bread, has become a worldwide food trend. Bruschetta is yet another great Italian variation of pizzathat is, crust with topping. So much has been written about how to make so-called authentic bruschetta that I will add only a few comments to the canon. You can use almost any kind of bread, but the best bread to use is rustic bread, like ciabatta or pugliese, with big holes and an easy-to-crisp texture. Slice it medium-thin, brush it with olive oil (garlic infused, if you like, or use garlic butter), and toast it under a broiler or in a saute pan over medium-high heat until crisp. Then top it with your favorite topping, the most popular being fresh chopped tomatoes marinated in chopped fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil, coarse salt, and pepper. Another option is to simply rub a slice of the bread with a clove of garlic, and then toast it. You can return the topped slices to the broiler if you want to melt cheese or heat up the topping. There are no rules governing toppings except one, the classic culinary law: flavor rules. Smoked eggplant puree is a topping that we love at home. To make it, buy 3 or 4 large eggplants and fire up a charcoal grill (this will not work as well on a gas grill, since you need the intense heat of hot coals). When the coals turn white, lay the whole, uncut eggplants on the grill about 5 inches above the coals. Turn them every 10 minutes, grilling until the outsides are charred and the insides are a soft mush. This will take 40 to 60 minutes. It is important that the eggplants grill until they become very mushy. Transfer them to a brown paper bag and close the bag to let them steam. When they are cool enough to handle, after 20 to 30 minutes, cut them open. Working with one at a time, scoop the soft interior eggplant flesh into a bowl. Discard the charred skin, the hard core, and any large seed sacs. Season the flesh with fresh lemon juice (about 2 tablespoons per eggplant), extra virgin olive oil (about 1 tablespoon per eggplant), and coarse salt to taste (start with 1/2 teaspoon per eggplant and increase from there). Puree this mixture in a food processor, adjusting the salt and lemon juice to taste. Black pepper or ground cayenne pepper can be added to taste. This makes a very smoky, lively dip, perfect for spreading on bruschetta and serving either cold or warm. Pugliese % Biga: 105% Fancy durum flour: 100% Salt: 3.8% Instant yeast: 1.1% Mashed potatoes: 20% Water (approx. ): 85% Total: 314.9% Some people with gas stoves smoke the eggplants by turning them at 3-minute intervals over a gas burner, resting the eggplant against the grate as it chars. This is a messy but viable alternative to grilling over hot coals.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Roasted Vegetables. Ingredients: 1 vegetables, of choice in the amount needed (see below for examples), 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt (I use sea salt because it adds a little crunchiness) or 1 teaspoon sea salt (I use sea salt because it adds a little crunchiness), fresh ground black pepper, Instructions: General Directions:. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Use a rimmed sheet pan. Lay out the vegetable in a single layer. No heaping. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper. With clean hands, toss the vegetables to be sure each one is coated with oil and seasonings. Place in preheated oven and roast for specified time. ASPARAGUS: For 4 servings, youll need 1-1/2 pounds. Snap off the woody ends at their natural breaking point. Lay out on pan and follow General Directions. Roast for 15 minutes until tips are browned and starting to crisp, shaking the pan halfway. Sandra Lee tops her asparagus with 1/3 cup kalamata olives (pitted) bbefore placing in oven. Robin Miller tops hers with slivered almonds 5 minutes before cooking time is up. Michael Chaiarello makes bundles of 4-5 asparagus spears and wraps them in a slice of proscuitto and roasts as directed. You may also top the roasted asparagus with grated or shredded Parmesan cheese. BEETS: According to Ina Garten, do not peel beets but scrub them well. Quarter them and roast following general directions. When they are done, they will be tender on the inside and crisp on the outside. BROCCOLI: Youll need 2 bunches of broccoli for 4 servings. This recipe for Roasted Broccoli with Cherry Tomatoes is from The Neelys. Cut the broccoli into 2-1/2 inch long florets. Place in large bowl. Add a chopped shallot, 1 pint cherry tomatoes, whole, 3 cloves garlic, chopped, and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Drizzle with 4 tablespoons olive oil, salt and pepper as directed. Toss to coat and spread out onto a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast until stems are tender-crisp and lightly golden brown, about 18 minutes. Grate 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese over the broccoli while its hot. BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Here is Claire Robinsons recipe for Crispy Brussels Sprouts. For 4 serving youll need 2 pounds of sprouts. Trim them by cutting off the stem end and pulling off any yellow outer leaves, and halve them. Lay 8 ounces of thick slab applewood smoked bacon, cut in 1/1/4 pieces. Lay the pieces out on a rimmed sheet pan and bake 10 minutes in preheated oven. Remove bacon with slotted spoon and transfer to paper towels to drain. Carefullly toss sprouts in the hot pan and season with salt and pepper. Return pan to oven and roast, turning once, until golden brown, about 20 minutes. remove from oven, and add a granny smith apple, peeled and chopped and 1/4 cup toasted chopped walnuts. Toss to combine. Transfer to serving platter, top with bacon and serve warm. Ina Garten roasts her sprouts whole following the General Directions and roasting for 35-40 minutes and shaking the pan several times. BUTTERNUT SQUASH PUREE: Youll need 2 squash (about 2 pounds) for 4 servings. Halve the squash lengthwise and remove seeds and strings (see Recipe#50958 for what to do with the seeds). Rub the insides with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Season with salt and pepper. Place on roasting pan, skin side down. Bake in preheated 350 degree F. oven (different temperature) for 30-40 minutes or until fork tender. Remove squash from oven, scoop out the flesh and place in a food processor. Add zest of 1 orange, 3 tablespoons orange blossom honey and 2 tablespoons butter. Puree until smooth. Add a pinch of salt and of ground cinnammon. Pulse a few more times to incorporate. BABY CARROTS: Youll need 1-1/2 pounds of baby carrots for 4 servings. Toss together the carrots, 1 red onion cut into 8 wedges, and 1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried) with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Roast 30-40 minutes until well browned. CAULIFLOWER: Youll need 1 head (about 1-1/2 pounds) for 4 servings. Cut off the florets and slice them vertically into 1/4-inch slices which will cook llike fans. In the rimmed roasting pan, drizzle the florets with 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper as in General Directions; toss. Place in a preheated 425 degree F. oven (note the different temperature) and roast for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Sprinkle with salt to taste. Recipe from Southern Living. CHERRY TOMATOES; Youll need 3 pints for 4 servings. Follow General Directions and roast anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes, depending on how soft you lilke them (they will collapse). Ina Garten roasts them 10-20 minutes, Tyler Florence roasts them 10 minutes and Mission Foods suggests 2 minutes. When roasted, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley, or 20 fresh basil leaves, chopped or julienned. Claire Robinson adds 3 garlic cloves to the pan before roasting for flavor. Tyler Florence roasts his tomatoes on the stems for presentation. Instead of olive oil, he uses Orange Chili Oil (make by adding 5 strips orange peel, 1-1/2 teaspoon chili flakes, 2 sprigs rosemary, and 4 sprigs thyme to 1-1/2 cups olive oil.) Emeril Lagasse tosses his tomatoes, before roasting, with the olive oil, salt and pepper as in the General Directions as well as red pepper flakes. Afterward he sprinkles with chopped parsley or basil. CORN ON THE COB: Youll need 4 ears of corn for 4 servings. Do NOT husk the corn. Corn is roasted completely differently from the General Directions. Lay the corn in its husks directly on the oven rack and roast until the corn is soft when you press on it, 30-40 minutes. Tyler Florence combines 1/4 pound butter, 2 teaspoons chili powder and zest of 1 lime and uses this to butter his cooked corn. To eat roasted corn. Peel down the husks and tie in a knot to use as a handle while eating. Rub the corn with the soft butter mixture. Tyler says that this roasting method produced the sweetest corn he has ever tasted. FENNEL: Youll need 3 fennel bulbs for 4 servings. Remove the stems and slice the bulbs in half lengthwise. With the cut side down, slice the bulb vertically into 1/2-inch slices, cutting right through the core. Roast them following the General Directions. Roast them for about an hour, turning them once after 30 minutes. Sprinkle them with 2-3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese and roast 5 more minutes. GREEN BEANS: You will need a pound of green beans for 4 servings. Here is Mills and Ross recipe for cooking. Rinse and drain beans and trim off and discard the stem ends. Place beans in rimmed baking sheet. Peel a small onion and cuts into slices 1/4-inch wide. Separate rings and scatter them over the green beans. Peel 4 cloves of garlic, cut in half, and scatter them over the onions. Then proceed according to the General Directions with oil and seasonings. Roast for 30 minutes, stirring twice. When done, remove from oven and drizzle with 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar. ROASTED BABY PUMPKINS: Youll need 4 pumpkins for 4 servings. Directions are different than the General Directions. Cut off and reserve the tops of each pumpkin by cutting around the stem in a circle. Scoop out the seeds with a small spoon and liberally sprinkle the insides with salt and pepper. Place pumpkins of greased baking sheet and fill each one with applesauce. Place tops back on and roast them for 45 minutes to 1 hour in a preheated 350 degree oven (note different temperature), until tender but not mushy.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Fig and Pear Charlotte. Ingredients: 2 (29-ounce) cans pear halves packed in syrup, 2 cups water, 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, Pulp of 1 plump, moist vanilla bean, 8 soft, moist dried Calimyrna figs, 1 recipe Ladyfinger Batter, recipe follows, Soaking syrup, recipe follows, Poire William Cream Filling, recipe follows, Fresh figs, for garnish, optional, Instructions: Drain the pears and place them in a large, deep bowl. Set aside. Bring the water, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla bean pulp to a boil in a medium saucepan or the microwave. Remove the syrup from the heat and pour it over the pears. Press a piece of waxed paper against the pears and, if the paper alone isnt enough to submerge the pears in the syrup, place a plate on top of the waxed paper. Cover the syrup with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. (The pears can be made up to 3 days ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator.) Cut the figs into small cubes (about 1/4-inch) and put them in a small saucepan. Cover with water and bring the water just to the boil. Transfer the figs and water to a container, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Make the ladyfingers, according to recipe below; bake, cool, and reserve. (The ladyfinger disks and bands can be made ahead, wrapped airtight, and kept at room temperature for 2 days or frozen for a month.) To assemble the charlotte: Remove and drain 3 of the pears, pat them dry between paper towels, and cut them into cubes, about 1/2-inch. Drain and pat dry the cubed figs. Mix the fruits together. Place a piece of parchment paper on a cardboard cake round and center an 8 3/4-inch/22-cm dessert ring on it; butter the inside of the ring. Cut the bands of ladyfingers in half lengthwise and fit the halves around the interior of the ring, making certain that the biscuits flat side faces in; you will have a piece of band left over. Fit a ladyfinger disk into the bottom to form a base. (If you are using store-bought ladyfingers, cut the biscuits as necessary to form a band and base.) Brush the ladyfinger disk and band with the soaking syrup, using enough syrup to thoroughly moisten the cake. Spoon enough filling into the biscuit-lined ring to form a layer that comes about halfway up the ladyfinger band, and spread it evenly with a spatula. Cover with the cubed fruit and then cover the fruit with another layer of filling, this time coming almost to the top of the ring, and again using the spatula to get an even layer. Top this with the second ladyfinger disk and moisten this layer with some syrup. (You may have syrup left over). Cover the disk with a thin layer of filling (you may have filling left over; it makes a fine dessert on its own or served with cookies) and set the cake into the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours. (The cake can be made to this point and, when chilled, covered airtight and frozen for up to 2 weeks.) Remove the dessert ring, but keep the cake on the cardboard round for maneuverability. Slice the remaining pears from the blossom to stem end, and arrange the slices in overlapping concentric circles over the top of the cake. If fresh figs are available, slice them from blossom to stem end and slip them into the arrangement. If not, a purely pear topping is just fine. Serve the cake now or keep it in the refrigerator, loosely covered, until ready to serve. 6 large egg whites 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 5 large egg yolks 1 cup minus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, sifted Confectioners sugar, for dusting Prepare the batter: In an impeccably clean, dry mixer bowl with a clean, dry whisk attachment in place, whip the egg whites on high speed until they turn opaque and form soft peaks. Still whipping on high, gradually add 2/3 cup of the sugar. Continue beating until the whites are glossy and hold very firm peaks. Its important that the whites develop into a really firm meringue; this is what will allow the batter to rest on the counter for 15 minutes and still maintain its shape. Set aside for the moment. In another bowl, whisk the yolks and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar together until they are well blended, about 1 to 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the yolk mixture into the beaten whites. Then fold in the flour, sifting the flour over the mixture in a few additions and incorporating it gingerly. (No matter how delicately you fold in the flour, the batter will deflate. Dont worry, but do be gentle.) The batter is now ready to be piped and baked. To pipe and bake: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain 1/2-inch tip and set aside until needed. Cut 2 pieces of parchment paper to fit 2 large baking sheets. On each sheet of paper, draw a 9-inch circle and, across 1 of the ends of the sheet, draw a band that is 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. Turn the sheets of paper over and place each piece of parchment on a baking sheet. (If you cant see the outlines clearly now that the paper is flipped over, darken the pencil lines.) Gently spoon a little more than half the batter into the pastry bag. Position a baking sheet so that the top and bottom lines for the 8-inch long band run from your left to your right. Start making a ladyfinger band by piping plump logs of batter from top to bottom within the pencil lines. Pipe 1 ladyfinger log right next to the last one so that they touch (they are supposed to). Keeping firm and steady pressure on the pastry bag, you should end up with ladyfingers that are about 1-inch wide and about 2/3 to 3/4-inch high. When youve piped the full 8-inch band, dust it lightly with confectioners sugar and pipe the second band in the same fashion; dust it with confectioners sugar too. Refill the bag when you run out of batter. (The bands will probably take about 2/3 of the batter.) Next, pipe the disks, keeping in mind that the disks should be only about half as high as the plump ladyfinger bands, so you can exert less pressure on the pastry bag. For each disk, begin piping the batter at the center of the circle. Work your way in a spiral to the penciled edge and try to have each coil of batter touch the preceding coil. If you have any holes, you can run an offset spatula very lightly over the disks to fill in the spaces. Let the piped batter rest on the counter for 15 minutes, during which time the confectioners sugar will pearl or form beads. Give the bands a second light dusting of confectioners sugar (there is no need to sugar the disks) and slip the baking sheets into the oven. Insert the handle of a wooden spoon into the oven to keep the door slightly ajar. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, just until the disks and bands are very lightly golden; you dont want the cake to take on much color. Slide the parchment off the baking sheets and transfer the cakes, on their parchment sheets, to racks. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature. When the cakes are cool, run an offset spatula under the disks and bands to loosen them from the paper. If you want individual biscuits, separate the cookies with a sharp knife or pizza cutter. If you want a decorative ladyfinger band that can be wrapped around cakes or charlottes, keep the cookies intact but cut the band in half lengthwise, or according to the measurements given in the specific recipe. Yield: enough for 1 charlotte 6 tablespoons water 1/3 cup sugar 4 1/2 tablespoons Poire William (pear eau-de-vie) Bring the water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan or the microwave. Remove from heat and, when the syrup is cool, stir in the Poire William. (The syrup can be made up to a week ahead and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator.) Yield: enough for 1 charlotte 7 ounces (about 4) pear halves (from Fig and Pear Charlotte recipe above) 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk 1/2 cup (slightly rounded) sugar 4 large egg yolks 2 tablespoons Poire William (pear eau-de-vie) 2 1/2 teaspoons (1 packet) gelatin 1/4 cup cold water 1 cup heavy cream Drain the pears and then puree them in a blender or food processor; set aside. Fill a large bowl with ice cubes and have ready a smaller bowl and a fine-mesh strainer. Bring the milk to a boil in a small heavy saucepan. Meanwhile, whisk the sugar and yolks together in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan. Whisking without stopping, drizzle in about 1/3 of the boiling liquid. Once the yolks are acclimated to the heat, whisk in the rest of the milk in a slow, steady stream. Place the saucepan over medium heat and, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, cook the cream until it reaches 180 degrees F, as measured on an instant-read thermometer (this will take less than 5 minutes). Alternatively, you can stir the cream, and then draw your finger down the spatula or the bowl of the wooden spoon, and if the cream doesnt run into the track youve created, its done. The cream will not thicken much. Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the cream to rest for 2 minutes. Strain the creme anglaise into the small reserved bowl and stir in the Poire William. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and allow it to rest until softened. Heat in the microwave oven for about 15 seconds, or cook over low heat, until the gelatin dissolves. Stir the gelatin into the creme anglaise and then gently stir in the reserved pureed pears. Set the bowl in the ice bath, adding cold water to the ice cubes, and, stirring from time to time, cool the creme anglaise to about 70 degrees F. To finish the filling, whip the heavy cream until it holds medium-firm peaks and fold it gently into the creme anglaise with a rubber spatula. The filling is now ready and should be used immediately. Yield: enough for 1 charlotte","

"Recipe Name: . About Pressure Cooking .. Recipe. Ingredients: These easy steps serve as a simple guide to using a pressure cooker. They are not intended, however, to be a substitute for the manufacturers instructions that accompany your pressure cooker model., Instructions: 1. Check recipe for specific cooking method and cooking time. 2. Pour required amount of liquid into the pressure cooker, then add in food. 3. Use the cooking rack if you like. 4. Always check the vent! Move the valve up and down to be sure it is working on a new generation cooker. Hold cover up to light and look through the vent pipe to make certain it is open and unclogged on the jiggle top models. (For more information see Safety Information below.) 5. Then, place cover on pressure cooker and close securely (cover handle should be directly above the body handle). 6. Place pressure regulator firmly on the vent pipe. 7. Heat the pressure cooker over high heat just till the pressure regulator begins to rock, or possibly the valve comes up to the first of second ring as stated in your recipe. (For more information see Pressure Settings below.) 8. Adjust heat lower to maintain a slow, steady rocking motion, or possibly the pressure indicator stays at the appropriate ring. Cooking times begin at this point. 9. Cook for the length of time specified in recipe, then reduce pressure as specified. 10. When recipe states \\""let pressure drop of its own accord,\\"" set the cooker aside to cold. When recipe states \\""cold cooker at once,\\"" cold immediately under a water faucet or possibly by pouring cool water over it. (For more information see Releasing Pressure below.) 11. Pressure is completely reduced when the air vent, pressure indicator or possibly cover lock has dropped. Dont try to force the lid open before the pressure drops. 12. Remove the pressure regulator, remove pressure cooker cover and serve food. SAFETY INFORMATION Its true, the newer pressure cookers have a lot more safety features than the older designs of our mothers and grandmothers time. A lot of people were scared away from pressure cooking because of childhood memories or possibly stories from relatives about kitchen explosions. In the years just before and shortly after WW II pressure cookers were very popular and in widespread use, and a few of those 60 year old diehards are still in use. Old pressure cookers were not manufactured the same as todays new generation cookers, and they lacked any safety features and whichs where the tales from urban legends come from. Read and understand your owners manual, as you become more familiar with pressure cooking experience will be your best teacher. Always do a visual inspection before cooking to be sure the lid is clean and in proper working order. To test your pressure cooker take it for a test drive before using it. If the only reason you bought a pressure cooker was to make chicken like KFC, read the warnings and see if its worth the risks. PRESSURE SETTINGS Most pressure cooker recipes are made to cook at a standard of 15psi. This setting is the standard as determined by the USDA way back in 1917, and till the arrival of the new and improved 2nd generation pressure cooker with multiple pressure settings, all pressure cookers had just which one 15psi setting. Which pressure setting still remains as the standard today. Many pressure cookers will provide only one pressure setting, this is especially true of older pressure cookers with the jiggle top regulator weights. Generally this single pressure setting is HIGH or possibly 15psi, that is just fine because the majority of recipes call for cooking at which setting. Almost all recipes designed for the pressure cooker are made to be cooked at 15psi for a specific time, in fact this setting is so common which most recipes do not even need to mention it. If no pressure setting is stated cook at high, or possibly 15psi pressure for the stated time. If a recipe calls for a lower pressure setting, which will be stated in the recipes. Recipes which are designed for the new cookers may have recipes which require LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH pressure, or possibly on the first or possibly second red ring, that corresponds to the medium and high pressure settings. Some pressure cookers may have more rings and a wider range of pressure setting, others come with a selection switch and canners have a pressure gauge. Some pressure cookers offer variations of the original jiggle-top weights and use a stationary weight which doesnt rock, it just hisses, others have a dual or possibly triple weighted pressure regulator allowing you to set different pressure. REALEASING PRESSURE o Cool Water Release Method: (Fastest method, used to immediately stop the cooking process by lowering the heat AND the temperature.) If a quicker release of pressure is desired, the pot is carried to the sink and cool water run over the lid (but not the valve). This method is mainly used for food with very short cooking times where it is essential to stop the cooking process as fast as possible. For example risotto, polenta, or possibly fresh vegetables where you not only want to reduce the pressure AND stop all cooking so which veggies are still tender-crisp. If you plan on returning the P/C to the stove it will take longer to come back to pressure. o Quick or possibly Touch Release Method: (Quick, but not as fast as the cool water release, this vents the pressure but does not lower the heat of the food.) People often confuse the quick release with the cool water release. The valve on some new pressure cookers releases the pressure quickly with just the push of a button. This method is suggested if you wish to interrupt the cooking process in order to add in some further ingredients or possibly check food for doneness. By releasing the steam this way you can quickly open the pressure cooker without cooling off the pot and stopping the cooking process. Dont use this method for food which foams and is cooked on the first red ring! o Natural Release Method: (Slowest method to gradually drop the pressure and the temperature to finish the cooking process.) A third method of releasing the pressure is to remove the pressure cooker from the heat source and to allow the pressure to subside naturally. If you are cooking beans, potatoes, or possibly other foods that have a skin which you wish to remain intact, this is the preferred method. Many meats and other longer cooking recipes are finished this way. ACCESSORIES AND STORAGE One of the most important accessories you will need is a timer. A couple of extra min of cooking probably will not harm a pot roast, but it could ruin a more delicate dish or possibly any accompanying veggies. A rack or possibly trivot is a common requirement and often comes with the cooker. A steamer basket to keep foods above the liquid is also desirable for cooking some vegetables. For cooking desserts, you will need a 5-c. heatproof souffle dish (which fits in side your pressure cooker); 1/2-c. heatproof ramekins for puddings, custards and timbales; and a 7- or possibly 8-inch springform pan (to fit in your cooker) for cheesecakes. You should also have a heat-diffuser, that prevents direct contact between the heat source and the bottom of the cooker. It will be needed when preparing rice, pasta or possibly bean dishes to prevent sticking and scorching. When storing your pressure cooker, be sure to store it with the lid completely detached and to the side of the pot. If you store it closed, you will trap smells and odors inside the pot to greet you on your next usage. Thoroughly wash the rubber seal and rub it with mineral oil after each use to preserve it. The rubber seal should last through about 150 meals. Store the valve and rubber seal (if not attached) inside the cooker. GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR COOKER Usage: Pressure cookers adapt best to recipes which normally use a moist cooking method such as soups, stews, tough cuts of meats, artichokes, steamed puddings, etc. Add in vegetables at the very end to avoid a mushy result. Generally, cooks in high altitudes over 3,500 feet should increase cooking times by about ten percent. Liquid is an important part of pressure-cooking. The amount of liquid necessary will vary depending on the manufacturer. Some will require as little as one-half c. of liquid and others up to two c.. Tips and Hints: Pressure-cooking is really fairly simple, but here are a few important tips to remember. o Most importantly, be familiar with the owners manual for your particular cooker. Read it thoroughly and follow all manufacturers recommendations. o You can use more liquid than recommended, but never use less. o Read and understand the recipe before you begin. o Be sure the lid is properly closed and locked into position before developing pressure. o Use which timer! Timing is as important as developing pressure. o Once you have reduced pressure according to directions, shake the pot before opening the seal to readjust the inner temperature. o Cut same foods into pcs of uniform size to promote even cooking. When mixing foods, cut those which cook more quickly into larger pcs and those which cook more slowly into smaller pcs. o If your recipe calls for browning or possibly searing as a preliminary step, be sure to scrape up the brown bits clinging to the bottom so they are loose when you add in the liquid. This will discourage scorching. o Since flavors are more concentrated with this cooking method, you may want to reduce herbs and seasonings when converting conventional recipes. Choose fresh herbs over dry herbs. o If you end up with too much liquid, simply cook in the uncovered pot till the liquids are reduced to your satisfaction. o If you desire the flavors of foods to mix, let them come into contact with the liquid that transmits flavors. If you dont wish flavors to mix, place individual foods on a rack above the liquid. Steam does not transmit or possibly mix flavors. o When cooking dry beans, cereal grains, lentils, split peas, rice or possibly other foods which","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Quartet of the Sea. Ingredients: 6 ounces sushi-grade ahi tuna loin, 2 heads endive, plus additional leaves for plating, 2 tablespoons butter, Salt, 1/2 tablespoon sugar, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, Lemon Vinaigrette, recipe follows, Fleur de Sel, for garnish, Instructions: Slice tuna very thin into pieces roughly 1 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches. Roll slices up and set aside. Cut the endive into fine julienne pieces. Warm a saute pan to a medium temperature and then add the butter. Add the endive to the pan, lightly season with salt, and stir. Allow the endive to caramelize. When the endive is golden in color, add the sugar and stir. Allow the sugar to caramelize. Add the lemon juice to deglaze the pan. Cut the additional raw endive leaves into a julienne and lightly dress with some of the Lemon Vinaigrette. Put a dollop of the caramelized endive in the middle of each plate. Place a small amount of the raw endive salad on top the cooked endive and then top with the tuna. Place additional raw endive salad on top of the tuna and drizzle some additional dressing around the plate. Garnish with a pinch of fleur de sel. 1/4 cup lemon juice 1 lime, zested White pepper 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups olive oil In a mixing bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lime zest, white pepper to taste, and salt. Whisk until the salt has fully dissolved. While still whisking, slowly pour the olive oil into the bowl. When all of the oil is incorporated, the dressing is finished. 4 (size U-15) fresh scallops 2 ounces fresh black truffles Crispy Shallots, recipe follows Fleur de Sel, for garnish Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling Slice the scallops into very thin pieces, about 1/16 to 1/8-inch thick. Gently clean all dirt off of the truffle. Cut the entire truffle into julienne pieces. Place 2 scallop slices in the middle of each plate so that the slices are next to each other. Place Crispy Shallot rings next to the scallops on 1 side only. Cover the tops of the scallops with the black truffle. Finish with a sprinkle of fleur de sel and a light drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. 4 shallots 1 cup milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 quart vegetable oil Peel off the outside skin from the shallots. Cut the shallots into rings and then separate the layers of the shallots. Place the rings into a container and cover with the milk. Let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours. When ready to cook, heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a large, heavy Dutch oven. Take the shallots out of the milk and dredge them in the flour. Carefully add to oil and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden and crispy. 8 to 10 pieces fresh spinach 8 Kumamoto oysters 1 cup kosher salt 1 ounce creme fraiche 2 ounces Iranian Osetra caviar Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach to the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer spinach to a napkin-lined tray to drain. Shuck all of the oysters, reserving them in the shell. Place 1/4 cup salt in the middle of each plate and position 2 oysters on each bed of salt. Place a small amount of creme fraiche on top of the oysters, then 1 or 2 pieces of wilted spinach on top of the creme fraiche. Then put a dollop of caviar (about 1/2 ounce per plate) on top of the spinach. 2 gallons water 1/4 cup kosher salt 1 (1 1/2-pound) Maine lobster 2 blood oranges Carrot Curry Puree, recipe follows 16 leaves fresh chervil Blood Orange Juice, recipe follows In a large stockpot, bring the water and salt to a boil. Add the lobster to the boiling water and cook for 7 to 10 minutes. Take out of the boiling water and place into an ice water bath to chill. When the lobster has cooled, remove from the ice water. Remove the tail from the head by holding the head with 1 hand while your other hand gently twists off the tail. Remove the tail meat from the shell. Cut the tail meat into medallions about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick, yielding 8 medallions. Cut off the top and bottom of the oranges. Remove the skin from the orange so there is no pith left. Then cut out the segments of the orange, removing any seeds. Cut each segment into 3 to 4 pieces. Put a dollop of the Carrot Curry Puree in the middle of each plate. Place 1 lobster medallion on each side of the puree. Place 1 chervil leaf at each corner of the lobster. Scatter the diced blood oranges next to the chervil. Lightly drizzle the Blood Orange Juice around the plate. 2 large carrots 2 tablespoons butter 1 shallot, minced 1/2 teaspoon curry powder 1 cup chicken stock Salt Peel and roughly chop the carrots. Heat a saute pan over medium heat and then add the butter and shallots. Saute until the shallots are tender and translucent. Add curry powder and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the carrots and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add chicken stock and deglaze the pan; bring to a simmer and continue to cook until the carrots are tender. Transfer mixture to a blender* and season with salt, if needed. *When blending hot liquids: Remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release one corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times then process on high speed until smooth. 1/4 cup freshly squeezed blood orange juice 1 tablespoon blood orange zest 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Place the juice into a mixing bowl and then add the zest and oil. Gently stir until mixed.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Croissants. Ingredients: 4 2/3 cups (21 oz / 595 g) unbleached bread or all-purpose flour, 1 3/4 teaspoons (0.4 oz / 11 g) salt, or 2 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, 1/4 cup (2 oz / 56.5 g) sugar, 1 tablespoon (0.33 oz / 9 g) instant yeast, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (7 oz / 198 g) cold whole or low-fat milk, 1 cup (8 oz / 227 g) cool water (about 65F or 18C), 2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) unsalted butter, melted or at room temperature, 1 1/2 cups (12 oz / 340 g) cold unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons (0.57 oz / 16 g) unbleached bread or all-purpose flour, Instructions: To make the detrempe, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Pour in the milk and water, then add the butter. If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute. If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 1 minute. The dough should be coarse, wet, and shaggy. If its very wet, like a batter, add a little more flour. If its firm like regular bread dough or stiff, drizzle in a little more water. Resume mixing with the paddle attachment on the lowest speed or by hand for another 30 seconds, then increase the speed to medium-high or mix more vigorously for 10 to 15 seconds. The dough will begin to smooth out but should be very soft, supple, and sticky, but not batterlike. Add more flour or water as needed, but mix only until the dough has formed. It is important that it be very soft and pliable, and somewhat sticky. If its dry to the touch, it needs more water. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and, with floured hands, form it into a ball. Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl, and immediately refrigerate overnight or for up to 2 days. Leave the detrempe in the refrigerator until youre ready to assemble the laminated dough, and make the butter block just prior to incorporating it into the detrempe. Cut the cold butter into about 16 pieces and put the pieces in a mixing bowl along with the flour. I recommend using a mixer, as its so much easier. Use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for about 1 minute to break down the butter into smaller pieces. Stop the machine and scrape down the bowl and paddle as needed, then mix again until the mixture is no longer lumpy. Increase the speed to medium-high as the butter pieces smooth out, and continue mixing until all of the lumps of butter are gone and you have a smooth paste. (Though its harder, you can also do this by hand by squeezing the butter and flour for a few minutes until you have a smooth paste. It should be cool to the touch, not warm. You can also use a food processor, but be sure to use pulses rather than running the processor continuously, or the butter may melt.) Prepare a sheet of parchment paper, waxed paper, or a silicone mat by misting it lightly with spray oil. Use a bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the butter block into a pile in the center of the prepared surface. Mist the top of the butter with spray oil, then cover it with plastic wrap. Press down on the plastic wrap gently but firmly to spread the butter into a 6-inch square (you can also use a rolling pin to lightly tap and roll it into a square). If necessary, lift the plastic wrap and use a metal pastry scraper or bowl scraper to trim off uneven corners or sides, putting the trimmings in the center of the butter block or using them to fill any gaps. The butter block should be about 1/2 inch thick and smooth across the top, with nicely squared-off corners. If the butter block has warmed up or seems to be melting due to friction or hand warmth, place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes (parchment and all). To incorporate the butter block into the detrempe, clear enough space on the work surface to roll out the dough (eventually) to a width of about 32 inches. Make sure the surface is completely dry, then dust it generously with bread flour or all-purpose flour. Transfer the detrempe to the work surface and sprinkle more flour over the top of the dough. Use a rolling pin and, with gentle pressure, roll out the dough to a rectangle about 12 1/2 inches wide and 6 1/2 inches long. Always begin by rolling from the center to the four corners, and then roll to the four sides to even it out. Check under the dough frequently, lifting it with a metal pastry scraper to see if it needs more dusting flour. (In addition to preventing sticking, the flour acts like ball bearings, allowing the dough to extend more easily.) Square off the sides and corners of the rectangle with the pastry scraper. The dough will be about 1/2 inch thick, the same as the butter block. Lift the parchment with the butter block and set it down atop the dough on the left side to check the sizing. The butter should cover only half of the dough, with just a 1/4-inch border on the left, top, and bottom. If it covers more than that, remove the butter block and roll out the dough a little wider or taller, as needed. If theres more than 1/2 inch of dough around the border, shrink the dough by scooting in the edges with the pastry blade or a sturdy ruler. When the dough and butter are properly matched, remove the plastic wrap and flip the butter block over onto the left half of the dough, again with a border of about 1/4 inch on the left, top, and bottom. Carefully adjust it into place before removing the parchment. You may need to use the pastry scraper to separate the parchment. If any butter sticks to the parchment, scrape it off and apply it to the top of the butter block, as evenly as possible. Lift the right half of the dough and fold it over the butter block to envelop or sandwich the butter. Stretch the dough along the top rim to seal the butter inside by pressing the top rim of dough to the rim of the underside and pinching them together to create a seal. You now have three layersdough, butter, dough. To laminate the dough, lift the dough, one side at a time, and toss more dusting flour underneath it. If the dough sticks to the work surface, use the pastry scraper to break the contact. Lightly dust the top of the dough with flour, then tap the rolling pin over the top of the dough to work out any air bubbles and spread the butter evenly into all four corners. Working from the center to the four corners and then to the four sides, gently roll out the dough into a rectangle, dusting under and on top of the dough with flour as needed. Continue rolling until you have a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle thats about 16 inches wide and 9 inches long. Square off the sides and the four corners, then fold the dough as if folding a letter: Fold the right one-third of the dough to the left, and as you lay it down, be sure to square it off so that the top and bottom edges are perfectly aligned with the underlying dough. Then fold the left one-third of the dough to the right in the same way. Use the rolling pin to press out any air pockets so that the folds lay flat, then gently transfer the dough to a lightly floured sheet pan and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes so the gluten can relax. If the butter seems very soft, you can put the pan in the refrigerator for this resting period. After the resting period, transfer the dough back to the floured work surface with the open seam facing away from you and the closed side facing you. Gently roll out the dough to a rectangle about 16 inches wide by 9 inches long, then once again fold it in thirds. Gently transfer the dough back to the floured sheet pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let the dough rest at room temperature (or in the refrigerator if the butter seems very soft) for 20 minutes. After the second resting period, once again transfer the dough to the floured work surface, closed side facing you, and gently roll it out and fold it as before. Gently transfer the dough back to the floured pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 minutes. You have now completed three turns and have created 81 layers of dough and butter. For the final roll-out and shaping, transfer the dough back to the floured work surface and gently roll it out, first from the center to the corners and then out to the sides, until the dough is just under 1/4 inch thick and forms a rectangle 24 to 28 inches wide and 9 inches long. (If you want to make small croissants or chocolate croissants, roll the dough into a rectangle about 32 inches wide and only about 7 inches long.) Be careful not to put too much downward pressure on the dough as you roll it, or the thin layers could break, but you do need to be somewhat firm, yet patient, as you roll. You may have to stop and dust with flour underneath the dough from time to time or give the dough a short rest if it starts to resist or shrink back. Square off the sides and four corners with the pastry scraper or a ruler. To make crescent-shaped croissants, begin by cutting out triangles. For full-size croissants, cut triangles about 9 inches long by 4 inches wide at the base. (The 9-inch length of the rolled-out dough will shrink to 8 inches as you cut.) Use a ruler or yardstick to measure and, starting at the left side, place a small notch at 4-inch intervals along the bottom edge of the dough with the pastry scraper or a knife. Repeat this along the top edge, but mark the first interval at 2 inches from the left end, then continue measuring at 4-inch intervals from that point on. For smaller croissants, roll the dough to only 7 inches long, which means it will be much wider, probably closer to 30 to 33 inches, and make the notches at an interval of only 3 inches, instead of 4 inches. Use a pizza cutter or a metal pastry scraper to cut a line from the left bottom corner of the dough to the notch in from the left at the top, then simply connect the marks to cut off the dough triangles. When all of the pieces are cut and separated, cut a 1-inch notch into the bottom center of the triangle base of each piece. Spread the bottom as wide as the notch will allow to create winglike flaps. Start with the flaps and begin rolling up the dough as if it were a rug. Gently pull out the top point (the nose) of the dough as you roll the bottom toward it, but be careful not to squeeze the dough or the layers will break. Stretching the nose will elongate the dough a bit as you roll it up. It should form in either 5 or 7 steps; if you only get 5 steps, you can give the flaps at each end a twist to create another set of steps if you like. Repeat with all of the dough triangles. (If you have any leftover scraps, simply roll them up to make mini croissants or coil them for Danish.) Place the croissants about 1 1/2 inches apart on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat, with the nose of each one positioned underneath so that its anchored. As you pan each croissant, give the end flaps a slight curve inward, facing in the same direction as the nose is pointing, forming a crescent shape. (If you dont want to bake all of the croissants at this time, place the extra croissants on a pan or in individual freezer bags and chill or freeze them.) Cover loosely with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. The croissants will rise slowly and swell noticeably in size, but they wont double. About 20 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450F (232C). Applying egg wash (see page 135) is an option at this point; some people like the glossy finish it provides, but I dont think its necessary. Place the croissants in the oven and lower the oven temperature to 375F (191C). Bake for 15 minutes, then rotate the pans and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes, until the croissants are a rich golden brown on all sides, without any white sections in the visible layers. If they seem to be baking unevenly or are getting too dark and have streaks of light sections, lower the oven temperature to 325F (162C) and extend the baking time as needed. The croissants should feel very light when lifted and be flaky on the surface. Allow the croissants to cool for at least 45 minutes before serving; an hour is even better. If served while still hot, theyll appear to be greasy because the butter hasnt yet firmed up and been fully absorbed into the pastry. One of the recipe testers accidentally left her melted butter for the detrempe on the stove too long and it browned. She used it anyway and reported that it added a wonderful flavor to her finished products. So consider using browned butter in your detrempe, but keep a watchful eye on it. Such a small amount of butter can go from brown to black very quickly. To bake frozen croissants, remove the shaped croissants from the freezer at least 3 hours before you plan to bake so they can thaw. Dont bake them while theyre still frozen or they wont rise or bake evenly. Once the croissants have thawed, follow the baking instructions in the recipe.","```cypher
