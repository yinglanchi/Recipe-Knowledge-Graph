"Recipe Name: Cannelloni with Asparagus and Ham. Ingredients: 2 pounds asparagus, 6 tablespoons butter, 1 cup water, Salt, 6 ounces boiled unsmoked ham, 3 cups milk, 6 tablespoons butter, 4 1/2 tablespoons flour, Pinch salt, 1 cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano (Parmesan), 1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg, 2 large eggs, About 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour, Instructions: Trim 1 inch or more off the butt ends of the asparagus, leaving only the moist, tender part of the stalk. Pare away the tough green skin from the base of the spear to the end of the stalk. Remove any tiny leaves sprouting below the base of the tip. Cut the trimmed asparagus into 2-inch lengths and wash in cold water. Choose a lidded, shallow pan large enough to accommodate all the asparagus. Put in 4 tablespoons of the butter, the water, a little salt, and the asparagus. Cover and turn on the heat to medium. Cook until the asparagus is tender, but firm. If, when the asparagus is done, there is still liquid in the pan, uncover, raise the heat to high, and boil away the liquid while browning the asparagus lightly. Cut up the ham and chop it in a food processor, but take care not to chop it too fine. Add the asparagus to the processor bowl and run the processor very briefly once or twice. The asparagus should be cut up into small pieces, but not blended to a creamy consistency. Make the bechamel: Heat the milk over low heat until it forms a ring of pearly bubbles, but do not let it break into a boil. While the milk is being heated, melt the butter in a separate pan over low heat. When the butter melts, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. When the flour has been wholly amalgamated with the butter, but before it becomes colored, remove from the heat. Add 2 tablespoons of milk at a time to the flour and butter mixture, stirring steadily and thoroughly. Add 2 more tablespoons of milk when the first 2 have been incorporated smoothly and evenly into the butter and flour. Stir and repeat the operation until you have put in 8 tablespoons of milk. At this point you can add the milk 1/2 cup at a time, always stirring steadily to obtain a homogeneous mixture. When all the milk has been worked in, place the pan over low heat, add the pinch of salt, and stir without interruption until the bechamel is as dense as a thick cream. Put the chopped asparagus and ham in a bowl, add half the bechamel, 2/3 cup of the grated cheese, and the nutmeg. Mix well. Knead the dough for the pasta and thin it out, stopping at the next to last setting on the machine, as described below. Cut the pasta strips into 5- to 6-inch-long rectangles, leaving them as wide as they come from the machine. Parboil them, rinse them, and spread on dry cloth towels. Turn on the oven to 450. Choose a baking pan large enough (about to by 12 inches) to contain all the cannelloni snugly in a single layer. Smear the bottom generously with butter. Spread 1 tablespoon of bechamel on a plate. Place a rectangle of pasta over the bechamel, rotating it lightly so that its underside becomes coated. Over the pastas top side spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the asparagus mixture, thinning it evenly, but stopping just short of the edge of the pasta. Roll up the pasta softly, jelly-roll fashion, to form a cannellone. Place the cannellone in the pan, with the overlapping edge facing down. Repeat the operation, laying the cannelloni snugly side to side, until all the cannelloni are done. From time to time, smear more bechamel over the bottom of the plate, as necessary, but take care not to use up all the bechamel. When all the cannelloni are in the pan, spread the remaining bechamel over them, forcing some of the sauce into the spaces between the cannelloni. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/3 cup of grated cheese and dot with the leftover 2 tablespoons of butter. Place the pan in the uppermost level of the preheated oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until a golden brown crust forms on top. Allow to settle for 5 to 8 minutes before serving. To serve, do not cut into the cannelloni, but loosen them, one from the other, with a spatula. Making Pasta at Home by Machine THE FLOUR As Elizabeth David has demonstrated magnificently, one can write a volume about varieties of flour. When we focus on Italian cooking, however, and specifically on pasta, we limit our field to two basic kinds: soft-wheat, unbleached, all-purpose flour and durum or hard-wheat flour, also known as semolina or, in Italian, semola. The first is white, the second pale yellow. Each of the two varieties has its virtues and drawbacks. For the classic pasta of Bologna, stretched by hand with a rolling pin, only soft-wheat flour is used. It is lower in gluten than semolina, hence it is easier to hand stretch. Soft wheat has a gentler, warmer fragrance than that of semolinas, which is faintly sharp. The sweet-smelling pasta it produces is plumper in body and of a fluffier consistency than any made with durum wheat flour. On the other hand, it requires utmost heedfulness in the cooking, because it can quickly pass that dangerous line from firm to overdone. Semolina has so much tough gluten that it is next to impossible to stretch by hand in the Bolognese manner. It is more suitable for flat pasta compressed by a non-extruding home machine or for such industrially extruded shapes as spaghetti or fusilli. Pasta made with semolina flour is never as downy as the soft-wheat kind, but it makes up for it with a body tautly knit and admirably compact. It accepts an extraordinary variety of sauces and cooks to a perfect al dente, firm-to-the-bite consistency. When buying semolina one must look out for flour that is ground too coarse. Unfortunately much of it is, including some brands that are sold as pasta flour. It should be talcum soft to the touch and impalpable, like other flour; otherwise it will be difficult to work with. At home I use semolina when I want extra firmness, such as in tonnarelli. More frequently I use all-purpose, unbleached flour, which makes pasta closer to that made at home in Bologna. The choice, however, depends on ones preferences. Both flours make equally valid pasta. THE DOUGH INGREDIENTS. The dough for homemade pasta consists of flour and eggs, nothing else. The only exception is when spinach or Swiss chard leaves are added to the basic egg and flour dough to make green pasta. Olive oil, salt, colorings, seasonings have no gastronomic reason for being in pasta. Some, such as olive oil that makes pasta slicker, are wholly undesirable and a detriment to good pasta. If one respects the freshness and immediacy of the Italian approach to cooking, one puts all flavors and seasonings in the sauce. PROPORTIONS. Use 1 cup of flour with 2 large eggs to produce approximately 3/4 pound of pasta. The exact ratio, however, will vary depending on the size of the eggs, their flour absorption capacity, even on the humidity of the environment. COMBINING THE EGGS AND FLOUR. Since you can never tell in advance exactly how much flour you will need, do not mix the flour and eggs in a bowl. You may find you want to use less flour than you thought. Pour the flour onto a work surface, shape it into a mound, scooping out a deep hollow in its center. Break the eggs into the hollow. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork as though you were making an omelet. Draw some of the flour over the eggs, mixing it, a little at a time, until the eggs are no longer runny. Draw the sides of the mound together, pushing to one side any flour you think you may not use. Work the mixture of flour and eggs with your fingers and the palms of your hands until it is well amalgamated. If it is still too moist, work in more flour as needed. Put the egg and flour mass to one side and scrape the work surface clean of all loose or caked bits of flour and of any crumbs of dough. Wash your hands and dry them. You are now ready to knead. MAKING SPINACH DOUGH. For approximately 1 pound of green pasta, use 2 large eggs, approximately 1 1/2 cups flour, and either 1/2 pound fresh spinach or half a 10-ounce package frozen leaf spinach. If using fresh spinach, trim away all the stems and wash the leaves in several changes of cold water to remove every trace of soil. Cook it in a covered pan over medium heat with only the water that clings to the leaves and with 1/4 teaspoon of salt to keep its color bright. Cook until tender, 15 minutes or more, drain, and let cool. If using frozen leaf spinach, cook it in a covered pan with 1/4 teaspoon of salt until tender. Drain and let cool. Squeeze all the liquid out of the cooked spinach with your hands, then chop it very fine. Follow the directions given for combining eggs and flour; beat the chopped spinach into the eggs in the well of flour before drawing any flour over them. KNEADING THE DOUGH. Kneading dough may be the single most important step in making good pasta. It is best done by hand, which takes no more, and possibly less, time and effort than with a machine, if you include the work required to clean the machine. Return to the egg and flour mass you had set aside. Push against it with the heel of your palm, keeping your fingers bent, fold it in half, give it a half turn, press hard again, and proceed thus for at least 8 minutes, pressing, folding, turning. If you are not sure that you have put in enough flour, push a finger into the dough as far as its center. It should come out clean and dry. If it is moist or there are bits of dough stuck to the finger, work in what additional flour you judge the dough needs. Unless you are ready to run the dough through the machine immediately, wrap it airtight in plastic wrap. Do not refrigerate it, but be ready to proceed with making the pasta within 2 or 3 hours at most. THE MACHINE THE TWO ADMISSIBLE KINDS. The basic pasta machine has paired steel rollers of two types: one is smooth and serves to compress and thin out the dough; the second set has parallel grooves that can cut the flattened dough into ribbons. Of this last set there are always two different pairs, a broad-grooved one that produces fettuccine and a narrower one that makes tagliolini. A movable handle can be inserted into different positions depending which of the rollers is to be turned. Less common now than it was before the introduction of the wretched extruding machines is the electric machine made by Bialetti. It works on the same principle as the hand-cranked version, over which it has two major advantages: the rollers are of plastic material with a gritty surface that makes pasta with a livelier texture and better sauce-absorbing qualities; it is electrically driven and faster so that it is both easier to use and kinder to the dough, which wants to be worked as rapidly as possible. No other kinds of machines than these two are suitable for making pasta at home. Those who already own a hand-operated machine can now buy an ingenious little motor that replaces the crank, converting any hand-turned machine into an electrically driven one. ROLLING OUT THE DOUGH WITH THE MACHINE. Flattening a ball of dough into a thin sheet is the pasta machines primary function. To perform it, it has several settings that bring the thinning rollers gradually closer together. Thinning the dough can be compared to reaching the sidewalk from a buildings sixth story. The fastest way is to jump, but you will be a mass of shattered bones. One of the reasons that pasta made by shops is generally so mediocre is that the dough is flattened all at one time, rather than step by step: its body is smashed, its vital sinew broken, it is inert. Walking down the steps is one safe way: it corresponds to the heedful use of the machines graduated thinning notches. Even less jarring would be to take the elevator: in making pasta, that would be the hand-stretched method. If you are thinning a ball of dough made with 2 eggs, divide it into 4 equal parts, or proportionally more parts if it is a larger amount. Cover the counter beside the machine with clean, dry, cloth kitchen towels. Set the thinning rollers at their maximum opening. Flatten 1 of the pieces of dough with your open hand and run it through the machine. Fold it in thirds, give it a quarter turn, and pass it through the machine again. Repeat the operation 2 or 3 times, then lay the flattened pasta strip on the towels. Take another piece of dough and flatten it as described above. Lay it next to the previously flattened strip on the towel, but do not let them overlap or touch. When all the dough has been flattened you can begin to thin it progressively. Close the opening of the rollers one notch and run the first of the flattened strips through it once. Do not fold it, but lay it flat on the towel. Repeat the procedure with all the other flattened pasta strips. When all are done, close the opening down another notch and thin all the strips again as has just been described. Continue thinning the pasta one notch at a time until it reaches the desired thinness. (Note: If you are making stuffed pasta, and you work slowly, take each piece of dough all the way through the thinning process, stuff it, then do the next piece. Keep the dough waiting to be thinned wrapped in plastic wrap.) CUTTING THE PASTA. If you are making lasagne, cannelloni, and any stuffed pasta, use the pasta immediately, as described in the appropriate recipe. For any pasta that encloses a stuffing, such as tortelli, tortellini, raviolini, the pasta must be cut and stuffed as soon as it is made, while it is still soft and sticky. Its softness makes it easier to shape and the stickiness is necessary to produce a tight seal, preventing the stuffing from spilling out during the cooking. For any kind of noodle, however, allow the strips to dry on the towels for 10 minutes or more, depending on the temperature and air circulation of your kitchen. Turn the strips over from time to time. The pasta is ready when it is still soft and pliant enough that it wont crack when cut, but not so moist that the noodles will stick to each other. Use the broad cutters on the machine to make fettuccine, and the narrower ones to make tagliolini. Tagliatelle, the classic Bolognese noodle, is slightly broader than fettuccine. If you are set on duplicating the Bolognese model, the pasta strips must be rolled up loosely and cut by hand into 1/4-inch-wide ribbons.","```cypher

MERGE (p)-[:CREATES]->(f)""Recipe Name: Making Egg Dough Pastas. Ingredients: DRY, 2 cups all-purpose flour, WET, 9 egg yolks from large eggs (2/3 cup), 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons water, (for 1 pound of pasta), DRY, 2 cups all-purpose flour, WET, 1 egg yolk (from a large egg), 3 large whole eggs, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, (for 1 pound of pasta), DRY, 2 cups all-purpose flour, WET, 2 large whole eggs, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 3 tablespoons water, (for 1 pound of pasta), Instructions: Measure the flour and shake it through a sieve into a medium-size mixing bowl (sifting aerates the flour). However, if you are making a mixed-flour pasta, dont try to sift; just stir or whisk the flours to blend them. Following the illustrations, drop the eggs and/or egg yolks (in the specified amounts) into a small bowl or measuring cup; beat briefly with a fork to break them up. Pour in the measured amounts of oil and water and mix well with the eggs. (In a measuring cup, you should have 7 fluid ounces.) Pour the wet ingredients into the flour. Toss and mix everything with a fork until all the flour is moistened and starts to clump together. Lightly flour your hands, then gather the clumpsor use a flexible plastic dough-scraperand begin kneading right in the bowl, folding the raggedy mass over, pushing and turning it, then folding again. Use the kneading action to clean the sides of the bowl. When youve formed a cohesive clump of dough, turn it out onto a small work surface lightly dusted with 1/2 teaspoon flour and continue kneading for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is smooth and shiny on the outside, soft throughout (no lumps), and stretchy. If your dough seems too sticky or too hard after it has been kneaded for a minute or two, adjust the consistency with very small amounts of flour or water and see box, page 157. If you are adding nuts to a dough, do it when you turn the dough out of the bowl (see page 172). Form the dough into a disk, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 1/2 hour. Store, very well wrapped, in the refrigerator for a day; or for a month or more in the freezer. Defrost frozen dough slowly in the refrigerator, and let it return to room temperature before rolling. Defrosted dough will need a bit more flour. Fit the regular steel cutting blade in the bowl of the processor (these a batches are too small for the dough blades of most machines). Measure the flour or different flours into the bowl; process for a few seconds to blend and aerate. Drop the eggs and/or egg yolks (in the specified amounts) into a spouted measuring cup or a small bowl; beat briefly with a fork to break them up. Mix in the measured amounts of oil and water (you should have 7 fluid ounces). To minimize the chance of overheating the dough, use eggs right from the refrigerator and cold water. Start the machine running with the feed tube open. Pour the wet mixture into the bowl quickly; scrape all the egg drippings out of the cup into the processor too. Let the machine run for about 1/2 minute. A dough should form quickly; most of it should clump or ball up on the bladesome may spread on the sides of the bowlwhere it will twist and knead. Let the machine knead the dough for about 10 seconds (no more than 40 seconds total processing). Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured surface, and knead by hand for another 1/2 minute or so, until its smooth, soft, and stretchy. Wrap and rest the dough, or store it as described for making the dough by hand. If you have problems in the food processorif theres no apparent clumping after 30 seconds, or the dough stiffens up very quicklystop the machine and feel the dough. Adjust for stickiness or dryness by working in either flour or water in small amounts (see box, page 157). You can continue to work the dough in the machine, but dont process for more than a total of 40 secondsor turn the dough out to correct the consistency and finish kneading by hand. stop the machine and feel the dough. Adjust for stickiness or dryness by working in either flour or water in small amounts (see box, page 157). You can continue to work the dough in the machine, but dont process for more than a total of 40 secondsor turn the dough out to correct the consistency and finish kneading by hand. When I make pasta at home, I rarely take out my pasta machine to roll out the dough. Even though Ive got a great machine (with a motor! ), I find that its still faster to cover the counter with a big wooden board, grab the thick wooden dowel I use as a pin, and start rolling. For most people, though, I think a sturdy pasta machine is an important, even essential, kitchen tool. (Im referring to the kind of machine with rollersnot the home pasta extruders.) The machine itself is simple to operate; the part that takes practice and attention is handling the dough, as I detail below. Once you get the feel of it, you can use your machine to develop your dough and then stretch it into thin and tender pasta quite quickly. So, if you dont have a machine, try to get oneand if you do, keep it readily available (not on the top shelf of a cupboard!) and use it often. Have your dough at room temperature for rolling. Cut 1 pound of dough into four pieces. Work with one piece and keep the others covered. Have a large tray or baking sheet nearby (or two if you have them) lightly sprinkled with flour, on which to lay thin dough strips. Smooth kitchen towels are also useful as resting surfaces and to separate layers of strips. Have flour for sprinkling and a knife or sharp pastry cutter handy too. Turn the knob to the widest settingyoull work at this setting for a while. Following the photographs press the first piece of dough with your hands into a circle or a small rectangle, then fold it in half, and roll it through the machine two times. Fold the now elongated rectangle in thirds, turn the dough 90 degrees (so the fold is on the side), and roll it through. Catch the dough; fold it and roll it through again with the fold on the side. Repeat the folding and rolling six more times (total of eight) to strengthen and smooth the dough. Like kneading, this will make it more resilient and workable. Lay the first piece down, sprinkle it with a tiny bit of flour on both sides, and cover it (with plastic wrap or a towel). Put the remaining pieces of dough through the same steps of rolling and folding. Either reset the rollers to the very next setting (slightly narrower) or skip to the third (even narrower)I generally roll dough at every other setting, from wide to narrow. Roll your first strip through, short end in first (dont fold it again). Let the rollers grab and move the doughdont push it or pull it throughand catch it in your hand as it comes out. Roll the strip again to stretch and widen it; lay the strip down (on the lightly floured tray) and stretch the others in the same way. Reset the machine even narrower; you should be on the third or fifth setting by now. Pass the first strip through once; it will lengthen rapidly, and you will need to catch and support it as it comes through the rollers. Flour the strip lightly if it is sticking to the rollers. After the second pass, if the strip is 20 inches or longer, cut it crosswise in half, to get two shorter strips. Lay these down (not overlapping) and dust with flour; roll and cut the other strips in the same way. You should have eight long strips at this point, each about 5 inches wide (nearly the width of the rollers). Because some doughs stretch more readily than others, the strips may be thin enough. If they are over 15 inches in length and you can nearly see through the dough, you can stop rollingif you want to. But if the pasta is 1/8 inch thick (and the strips are shorter than 15 inches), you should pass them through the next-narrower setting. Roll the dough as thin as you like, as long as it doesnt tear or fall apart. If it does tear, fold the strip in half or thirds (making it shorter and enclosing the tear) and reroll at wider settings. Set the finished strips down, lightly floured and not overlapping, in the big trays. If necessary, cover a layer of strips with a floured kitchen towel, and rest more strips on top. Have your dough at room temperature for rolling. Cut 1 pound of dough into three pieces (5 to 6 ounces each). Work with one piece and keep the others covered. Have flour close at hand for sprinkling when needed. Lightly flour the work surfacepreferably woodand rub a little on your rolling pin. Press the first piece of dough flat, then dimple it all over with your fingertips. Begin rolling it into a rectangle, about twice as long as it is wide. Working from the center of the dough, roll up and down, left and right. Occasionally, flip the dough over and dust the surface with flour if the dough is sticking; periodically, turn the dough 90 degrees. When the dough gets thin and floppy, you can also stretch it gently with your hands: grasp the edges and tug the dough on all sides to widen and lengthen it, evenly. Roll and stretch the dough until it is 20 to 24 inches on the long sides and about 10 inches on the short sides. Hand-cut this sheet of dough into your chosen shape, as detailed below, before rolling out the next piece. As soon as you have rolled all your dough pieces through the pasta machine or hand-rolled one piece, you can start cutting the shapes you want. Long flat shapes like tagliatelle (the same as fettuccine), tagliolini, or pappardelle are the quickest to cut (and cook). A machine attachment will cut tagliatelle or tagliolini precisely, but I like hand-cutting and the slightly irregular noodles I get. Details on both methods follow. Lacce (shoelaces) are hand-cut thicker strips (shorter than the others) that are also quick to produce and a good shape for doughs that dont roll very thin. If you are not in a rush, however, try the other shapes shown here: Maltagliatiwhich means badly cutare small diamond-shaped pieces (or rhomboids, in geometry). Garganelli are little quill-shaped tubes rolled from maltagliati. I especially love the last shape, boccoli, a spiral that resembles a little girls ringlets (boccolo is Italian for a curl). All three are made from long ribbons of dough, so you can easily make some of each from the same batch. Get someone to share the fun! You can cook all these shapes as soon as they are cut, or let them sit and dry at room temperature until you are ready, but use them within a day. Lay them out on trays as shown in the photos, lightly floured and separated so they dont stick togetherarrange long shapes in separate small nests, and other shapes in a single layer. Pasta that has air-dried will take a bit longer to cook. To freeze cut pasta for long storage, set the nests or individual pieces in single layers, floured and separated, on trays that fit into your freezer. After theyre solidly frozen, pack them in small airtight plastic bags or containers. Dont defrost before cooking; simply drop the frozen pieces into the boiling water. For 1 pound of pasta, bring 6 quarts of water to a full boil and stir in 1 tablespoon kosher or sea salt. The dough has no salt, so it is particularly important that the cooking water be well salted. Before adding the pasta to the water, shake off excess flour, using a strainer or colander or just shaking it in your hands. Drop the pasta into the boiling water in several batches, stirring with each addition to separate the pieces. Keep the heat high but dont cover the pot. Let the water return to the boil, stirring occasionally. Start timing when the boil resumes. Cook at the boil at least until the pasta rises to the top; at that point, many pastas are done (but some are not). Remove and taste a bit of pasta when it surfaces. Cooking times will vary with the composition of the dough, the shape and thinness of the pasta, and the degree to which it dried before cooking. Here are some general guides to cooking times: Fresh pastas are not cooked al dente like dried pastas. Cook them until they are tender all the way through and you have tested them. Tender white-flour pastas will cook the quickest. Rich Mans Golden Pasta (see above) will be done in as little as 2 minutes. Poor Mans Two-Egg Pasta (see above) will take a bit longer. Some mixed-flour pastas, like flaxseed and potato pasta, cook quite fast. Heavier, whole-grain pastas, like whole wheat, take considerably longerabout double the time. Flat long pasta cuts will cook more quickly than rolled shapes like garganelli or boccoli. Remove pasta from the cooking pot with a spider, tongs, or other tool, let excess water drain into the pot, and drop with clinging water into a skillet containing the sauce. Finish the pasta and sauce together following the procedures outlined on page 105. The Rolls-Royce of noodles! It tastes rich (and it is rich) yet has such a delicate texture it melts in the mouth and hardly seems filling at all. For all its tenderness, the dough is resilient and easy to work, but it cooks very quickly. Suggested Shapes and Sauces This pasta should always be the star of the show: cut it in long flat shapes, either tagliatelle or pappardelle. It will not take much dressing, since it has lots of flavor. Dress simply with butter and cheese (page 119), and top with a shaved truffle if you have one. Or serve it with the juice of roast meat or poultry. One traditional way is to dress it with Bolognese sauce topped with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano. Long-cooked savory sauces, such as guazzetto, make this a truly festive dish. But just remember not to oversauce and smother the pasta. You will sense the difference in your mouth: this pasta has a bit more substance to the bite than the all-yolk pasta. Still, it is quite tender and rich. Suggested Shapes and Sauces Another pasta to savor in simple flat cutstagliatelle, tagliolini, or pappardelle. Sauce with Marinara (page 130); also good with longcooking meat or vegetable sauces like Ragu alla Bolognese (page 143), either of the guazzetti (pages 151, 154), or Asparagus, Green Pea, and Scallion Sauce (page 135). Cheese sauces and game sauces are also good with this pasta. Firmer than the preceding two, yet flavorful and light, this is a versatile pasta that serves as an excellent carrier for all flavorful sauces. It is the pasta I recommend for ravioli and lasagna. Cut this pasta in any shape you like; sauce it with almost anything. Since it is not as rich as the first two, it goes very well with fish and vegetable sauces. Heres a specific recommendation: practice making boccoli (Shirley Temple curls) with this pasta and dress with Simple Tomato Sauce (page 132), or with vegetable and pesto sauces.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Marys Lasagna. Ingredients: 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, 1 cup (8-ounces) fresh ricotta, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, 4 or 5 large fresh basil leaves, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, plus more for pasta water, 1/2 batch Sunday Gravy with Sausages, recipe follows, 1/2 batch Meatballs, recipe follows, Salt, 1 recipe Georges Fresh Pasta, recipe follows, cut into lasagne noodles (4 to 5-inches wide by 12 to 13-inches long), 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano, 1 ball fresh mozzarella, drained and sliced, Instructions: Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Put a bowl of ice water near the stove, and set out a few towels next to the bowl to drain the pasta. Generously grease a 10 by 14-inch baking pan using 1 to 2 tablespoons of the butter. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix the ricotta, egg, and parsley together. Rip up the basil leaves and fold them into the ricotta mixture. Season with salt and set aside. With a slotted spoon, transfer the pieces of pork, sausage, and meatballs from the Sunday Gravy to a separate bowl. They will be coated with some of the tomato gravy. Thats okay. Set the remaining gravy and bowl of meats aside. Generously salt the boiling water and cook the lasagne sheets, a few at a time, at a rolling boil for 1 minute. The noodles will be very firm; they will cook further in the oven. Transfer the pasta to the ice water with a long-handled flat skimmer or strainer. As soon as they are cool to the touch- less than a minute- lift them out, shaking off excess water, and lay the noodles out on towels to drain. Repeat the process until all the pasta is cooked. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Cover the bottom of the baking pan with a layer of lasagne sheets, allowing the pasta to hang over all sides of the pan. Top with another layer of lasagne sheets cut to fit the bottom of the pan without an overhang. Cover the pasta with 1/2 of the reserved meats. Spoon over enough gravy to moisten well, about 1 cup. Sprinkle with a rounded 1/4 cup Pecorino Romano. Cover with another layer of pasta cut to fit without an overhang. Top with 1 cup gravy. Dollop 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the gravy and top with half of the mozzarella and a rounded 1/4 cup of Pecorino Romano. Repeat the pasta and meat layer and the pasta and ricotta mixture layer. Cover with a final layer of pasta (you may not have used all the lasagne sheets) cut to fit the inside of the pan without an overhang. Top with the remaining gravy and Pecorino Romano. Bring up the overhang of pasta and fold over the top of the lasagne to enclose the filling. Dot with remaining butter and loosely cover with foil. Bake the lasagne for 25 minutes, uncover, and continue to bake until very lightly browned and bubbling hot, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. To keep the top noodles soft without browning, bake the lasagne covered with foil for 35 minutes and uncovered for the last 5 to 10 minutes in the oven. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. The way to Georges heart is definitely through his stomach. The E-Z Pass is with spaghetti and meatballs. We make several different sauces for our meatballs but none is better than the recipe we learned from Georges mom, Mary Germon. Like most Italian-Americans, she called her sauce \\""gravy\\"" and it was part of every holiday feast and any Sunday dinner. She sauced spaghetti or homemade ricotta ravioli with this gravy. It is also the first step to making Marys Lasagne, another of her specialties. Mom had her own business and worked more than 40-hours a week. She was one of the original multi-taskers often doing the weeks laundry and ironing at the same time as preparing a meal for the family. She had this gravy put together and bubbling on the stove in no time flat--something George always reminds Johanne when she frets and fusses over it. This recipe makes a large amount of sauce, but it takes no longer than a small batch and it freezes well. Save what you dont use for Marys Lasagne, Ricotta Ravioli, or insurance in the freezer for an impromptu meal. 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 center-cut pork chops (total weight 1 to 1 1/4-pounds) 1 1/4 pounds Italian sweet sausage, halved horizontally 1 cup chopped onions 2 plump garlic cloves, finely minced 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 3 1/2 cups pureed canned tomatoes 4 1/2 cups water 1 (6-ounce) can (3/4 cup) tomato paste Cheese rinds from Parmigiano-Reggiano or ends of Pecorino-Romano, optional Marys Meatballs, recipe follows Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed stockpot. Add the pork chops and sausages and brown on all sides. Transfer the pork chops and sausages to a plate to make room for the onions. Toss the onions into the pot with the garlic, fennel, and salt. Saute over moderate heat, stirring frequently and scraping up any bits left behind by the pork and sausages, until the onions are soft and golden. Put the pork chops and sausages back in the pot with any juices on the plate. Add the tomatoes, water, and tomato paste. Drop in a few cheese rinds or ends if you have any. They are completely optional but give a nice flavor to the sauce. Cover the pot, bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Gently drop in the meatballs, 1 at a time, shaking the pot a bit to encourage the meatballs to nestle in with the pork and sausage and to make room for the addition of more meatballs. After all the meatballs have been added, continue to simmer, covered, for an hour longer or until the pork chops are very tender. To finish the gravy, transfer the pork chops to a cutting board. Remove and discard the bones, chop up the meat, and return it to the sauce. Keep warm over low heat. Yield: 6 to 8 servings 12 ounces ground beef 4 slices white sandwich bread, crust removed and cut into tiny cubes 3/4 cup milk 3/4 to 1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano 3 fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces, optional 1 tablespoon freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 egg, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt In a large mixing bowl, combine the beef, bread and milk. Add the cheese, basil, parsley, egg, and salt. Mix gently but thoroughly. Form into small meatballs. Marys were no more than 1 1/2-inch diameter. Yield: 26 to 28 meatballs Homemade, fresh pasta is glorious and well worth the effort. Nothing compares to the silky, light, slippery noodles you can produce in your own kitchen. This is a quick recipe. The dough is mixed in a food processor and a pasta machine kneads and rolls the dough. Georges whips this up easily, in 5 minutes tops. There are minor variations depending on the weather and the moisture in your flour (you may have to knead in an extra tablespoon or 2 of flour) but if you follow these proportions you will have excellent pasta. The organic eggs we buy at the farmers market vary in size. The most reliable way to get an accurate measurement is with a portion scale. The measuring cup method will work, too (crack eggs into a small mixing bowl, whisk to combine, pour the required amount into a liquid measuring cup, and discard or save any excess for another use). In making pasta, skill is developed through repetition. Each batch will be easier than the last and with a little experience exact measurements will be less important. Dont fret if the final dimensions of the pasta are different from those specified in the recipe. The strips coming through the rollers of the pasta machine may be longer and/or not as wide. The ends may also narrow rather than being perfectly square. For instance, the edge going through the rollers first will be u-shaped (they can be cut later to square the noodle, if you like). Practice does make a difference in developing a feel for the process. Try to roll the dough as wide as possible--a little less than the width of the rollers, but dont be discouraged if that doesnt happen the first time. Adjust the cutting of the pasta to the strips you have--less wide sheets of lasagna noodles, for instance. 2 jumbo eggs weighing 4 1/2 ounces in their shells, lightly beaten (slightly over 1/2 cup but less than 2/3 cup lightly beaten eggs measured in a liquid measuring cup) 1 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (10 ounces) all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon hot tap water Lightly whip the salt into the beaten eggs. Set aside. Put the flour in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. With the motor running pour the eggs through the feed tube. Stop the machine as soon as the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Run the motor again pouring the hot water through the feed tube. Pulse on and off for 10 seconds; stop the motor. The dough should stick together when pressed between your fingertips. If not add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon hot water and run the motor again. Turn out onto a cool, smooth surface--marble is ideal. Knead for 1 to 2 minutes until the dough is smooth and pliable. If it is sticky, knead in 1 to 2 tablespoons flour. Shape into a ball and cover the dough completely with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for a minimum of 20 minutes or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator. If the dough is refrigerated, remove it from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. Set up the pasta machine with the rollers at their widest opening. Divide the dough in 1/2. If the dough is sticky, dust it with flour. Flatten the dough half with the heel of your hand, and feed it through the rollers of pasta machine. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and feed it through the rollers again. Repeat 20 to 30 times occasionally folding widthwise to fit between the guides. This kneads and smoothes the dough further, creating silky and supple pasta. Now you can roll the pasta into thin sheets by feeding it through each successive setting of the pasta machine until you have passed it through the second thinnest opening (dust with just enough flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking). This process is done without folding. If the sheet of pasta becomes cumbersomely long cut it crosswise into 2 pieces to make it more manageable. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Lay the dough out on a barely floured counter or clean, dry kitchen towels. Each half of dough will yield 2 strips of pasta roughly measuring 3 feet by 4 inches. Yield: about 1 pound of pasta Try to make lasagna noodles as wide as your pasta machine allows (4 to 5-inches); cut the lengths the most appropriate size for the pan you plan to use--anywhere from 8 to 12-inches long (longer if you like, or shorter if smaller noodles are easier for you to handle. Lasagna noodles can be cut and patched together in assembly). Keep in mind the pasta will grow, or expand, when it boils, increasing its dimensions. After you have cut the noodles, you can cook them right away or lay them out in a single layer without touching on a lightly floured surface or on clean, dry kitchen towels until ready to cook (flour dusted or towel lined baking trays work well if you dont have counter) If you are not using the pasta the same day, allow it to dry completely, then transfer to long, shallow containers with lids. You can keep it in a cool, dry place for 1 week.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Lemon Uses. Ingredients: lemon, lemon juice, lemon rind, Instructions: Tips and Tricks:. If you only need half a lemon, dont throw the other half away! Squeeze the remaining lemon juice into an ice tray and freeze. Each ice cube of lemon juice is equals two tablespoons. (You can pop em out after theyre frozen and put them in a freezer bag for storage). Microwave lemons for 20 seconds before squeezing - that way, you get a lot more lemon juice out of every single one. The custom of serving a slice of lemon with fish dates back to the Middle Ages. It was believed that if you accidentally swallowed a fish bone, then the lemon juice would dissolve it. Most people now do it because lemon to enhance flavor and get rid of that \\""fishy\\"" smell. Get rid of cat litter box odor. Cut up a few lemons and put near the cat litter box. The lemons will soon neutralize the odor, leaving the room lemony fresh. Get rid of stain on marble. For stubborn stain on marble, cut a lemon in half. Pour some salt on top of the stain and rub with the cut lemon. Be careful, however, as the acid in the lemon can actually cause more damage. Get rid of ants. Squirt some lemon juice into holes and cracks where the ants are coming inches Place small pieces of lemon rinds or peels around the house. Get rid of roaches and fleas. Wash your floor with the juice of 4 lemons in about half a gallon of water. Get rid of moths. Hang a sachet of dry lemon rind in the closet to get rid of moths. Get rid of mothball smell. Now that you can use lemon to get rid of moths, you wont need those mothballs anymore -- but how do you get rid of the lingering mothball smell? Lemon to the rescue (again!) - simply wash the drawers and closet with a solution of lemon juice in water. Polish chrome. Got dull chrome faucets? Simply rub lemon rind, rinse and dry with a paper towel. Clean tarnished brass, bronze, copper, and stainless steel. Make a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and apply to the tarnished area. Let soak for 5 to 10 minutes and wash in soapy water. Air freshener. Put a mixture of lemon juice and water into a spray bottle. Voila! A natural and inexpensive air freshener. You can also put slices of lemon in a dish or a dish of lemon juice and baking soda mixture to help absorb bad odor and freshen the room. All purpose cleaning solution. Add lemon juice, vinegar, and water in a spray bottle for a natural, all-purpose cleaning solution. Furniture polish. For varnished wood, add a few drops of lemon oil into a cup of water. For unvarnished wood, mix equal parts of oilve oil and lemon juice. Use dry cotton rags to wipe the furniture. Toilet bowl cleaner. Make your own toilet bowl cleaner with 1 part of lemon juice to 2 parts of borax. You can get rid of toilet rings by applying this solution and letting it sit for a couple of hours before rinsing. Down(y) with laundry detergent! Skip the powders and turn the Tide against chemicals and Cheer for the Ultra alternative -- lemon! Use lemons instead of bleach. Soak clothes in a mixture of lemon juice and baking soda for half an hour before washing. Get rid of stain, mildew and rust. Scrub mildewed clothes with a paste of lemon juice and salt. Let dry in the sunlight, then wash. Remember to test for color fastness before using this technique! Whiten clothes. To boost your laundry detergent and whiten clothes, add 1 cup of lemon juice into the washer. Get rid of garbage disposal odor. If your garbage disposal smells bad, simply put leftover lemon and orange peels and grind them down the drain. Do this as frequently as needed to keep the garbage disposal odor away. Get rid of bad fridge odor. Heres an easy way to get rid of musky or bad refrigerator odor. Soak a sponge with lemon juice, place on a plate and leave it in the fridge overnight. Get rid of cutting board odor. After cutting meat, fish, onion, garlic and other smelly food, you can get rid of bad cutting board odor simply by rubbing it with half a lemon. This also works for wooden cutlery and bowls. Clean your microwave. Got hardened gunk of food in the microwave? Dont reach for harsh chemicals, use lemons instead! Add 1/4 cup of lemon juice to 1-1/2 cup of water and microwave on High for about 10 minutes. The water will boil and steam will condense inside the microwave. The gunk will easily wipe away with a paper towel or cleaning rag. Lift tough grease stain. Put lemon peel in a water with some water in a blender. Apply the mash to the tough grease stain and scrub. Brightens aluminum pots and pans. Fill the pot with water and add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, then boil for 15 minutes. For the outside of the pots and pans, scrub with a half of a lemon. Prevent potatoes and cauliflower from turning brown. Potatoes and cauliflower can turn brown after being boiled. To prevent this, simply add a teaspoon of lemon juice into the water before you turn on the stove. Prevent avocado and guacamole from turning brown. The culprit is oxidation - when a cut avocado is exposed to air, an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase change the structures of phenolic compounds in the flesh of the avocado and thus their color. Since the enzyme doesnt work as well in acidic environment, you can slow down this reaction by sprinkling lemon or lime juice. Prevent apple slices from turning brown. Same idea as above. For apple slices, simply rub them with half a lemon. Prevent rice from sticking. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice into the water before you cook the rice. The lemon will also make the rice whiter and brighter! Make lettuce crisp again. Got soggy lettuce? Dont toss it way - You can \\""revive\\"" it by squeezing half a lemon into a bowl of ice water.
