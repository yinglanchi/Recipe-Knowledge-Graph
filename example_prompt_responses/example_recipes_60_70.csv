"Recipe Name: Soft Rye Sandwich Bread. Ingredients: 1/4 cup (2 oz / 56.5 g) mother starter (page 42), cold or at room temperature, 1 2/3 cups (7.5 oz / 213 g) rye flour, 3/4 cup (6 oz / 170 g) water, at room temperature, All of the sour rye starter (15.5 oz / 439.5 g), 1 1/2 cups plus 3 tablespoons (13.5 oz / 383 g) lukewarm water (about 95F or 35C), 1 1/2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) molasses, 1/4 cup (2 oz / 56.5 g) vegetable oil, 2 1/4 teaspoons (0.25 oz / 7 g) instant yeast, 5 1/3 cups (24 oz / 680 g) unbleached bread flour, 3 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) cocoa powder (optional), 2 3/8 teaspoons (0.6 oz / 17 g) salt, or 3 1/2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, nigella seeds, minced dried onion, or anise seeds (optional), 3/4 teaspoon (0.17 oz / 5 g) orange oil or 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) orange extract (optional), 1 egg white, for egg wash (optional), 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash (optional), Instructions: To make the starter, combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl. If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute, then increase to medium speed for about 30 seconds. If mixing by hand, stir for about 2 minutes, until well blended. The starter should feel tacky or slightly sticky; if you use coarse rye flour, it will feel like modeling clay, and you may need to add another 2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of water to make it pliable. Transfer the starter to a clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl loosely, and leave it at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours, until the starter swells noticeably in size and develops a tangy aroma. If you plan to use the starter the same day, allow 1 more hour of fermentation. Otherwise, put the starter in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. To make the dough, cut the starter into 10 to 12 pieces and put them in a mixing bowl. Separately, combine the water, molasses, and vegetable oil, then whisk in the yeast until dissolved. Let stand for 1 minute, then pour the mixture over the starter and mix with the paddle attachment on the lowest speed or with a large spoon for about 1 minute to soften the starter. Add the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and seeds and orange oil. Switch to the dough hook and mix on the lowest speed, or continue mixing by hand, for 4 minutes. If the dough rides up on the dough hook, stop the mixer and scrape it back into the bowl. The dough should form a coarse ball thats soft, supple, and very tacky, verging on sticky. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Mix on medium-low speed or by hand for 2 minutes more, adding flour or water as needed to make a smooth, supple, tacky ball of dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for about 20 seconds, working in any final adjustments with flour or water, then form the dough into a ball. Place the dough in a clean, lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and immediately place it in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 4 days. (If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.) If baking the bread on the same day, leave the dough at room temperature for 90 minutes to 2 hours, until it doubles in size, and then proceed to shaping. The final rising time, after shaping, will be 60 to 90 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 3 hours before you plan to bake. Shape the dough into one or more sandwich loaves (see page 23), using 28 ounces (794 g) of dough for 4 1/2 by 8-inch loaf pans and 36 ounces (1.02 kg) of dough for 5 by 9-inch pans; or shape it into freestanding loaves of any size, which you can shape as batards (see page 21), baguettes (see page 22), or boules (see page 20). For sandwich loaves, proof the dough in greased loaf pans. For freestanding loaves, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat and proof the dough on the pan. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap, then let the dough rise at room temperature for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until increased to about 1 1/2 times its original size. In loaf pans, the dough should dome at least 1 inch above the rim. About 15 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350F (177C) for sandwich loaves or 400F (204C) for freestanding loaves. If youd like to use an egg wash to make the crust more shiny, whisk the egg white and water together, then brush the mixture over the tops of the loaves. Scoring is optional and only recommended for freestanding loaves. If youd like to score them, do so just prior to baking, making 3 to 5 horizontal cuts across the top, about 1/2 inch deep. Bake for 20 minutes, then rotate the pans and bake for another 20 to 35 minutes, depending on the size of the loaves. The total baking time is 40 to 55 minutes for large sandwich loaves and 25 to 45 minutes for freestanding loaves, depending on size. The bread is done when the loaves sound hollow when thumped on the bottom and the internal temperature is about 190F (88C). Remove the loaves from the pans and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving. Like most bakery rye breads, this recipe calls for sourdough starter, which actually contains all of the rye flour. If you dont have a mother starter, you can replace the sour rye starter by adding all of the rye flour from the starter instructions to the final dough, along with 6 to 7 ounces (170 to 198 g) of buttermilk or yogurt to provide some acidic tang. To make marbled rye bread, make two batches of dough, one light and one dark. To shape marbled rye loaves, cut each dough into 12 even-size pieces. Separate the pieces into 2 piles, with an equal number of dark and light pieces in each. Form each of the piles into a solid mass of dough by pressing them together. Shape each into a batard, as shown on page 21. You can bake the loaves freestanding (which is what I recommend) or in greased 4 1/2 by 8 1/2-inch loaf pans. For freestanding loaves, transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets (1 per loaf). Cover and proof. For braided marbled rye, divide the light and dark doughs into 4 even-size pieces each. Roll each piece into a strand 10 to 12 inches in length, thicker in the middle and slightly tapered toward the ends. Braid 2 light and 2 dark pieces together using the 4-braid method shown on page 98. You can bake the loaves freestanding (which is what I recommend) or in greased 4 1/2 by 8 1/2-inch loaf pans. For freestanding loaves, transfer to parchment-lined baking sheets (1 per loaf). Cover and proof. For bulls-eye loaves, divide the light and dark doughs into 4 even-size pieces each. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into an oblong about 5 inches wide and 8 inches long. Roll up a dark rye piece and shape it into a batard about 8 inches long, as shown on page 21. Take a light rye piece and wrap it around the batard, then seal the seam. Repeat with the remaining dough to make 4 small loaves. Place the loaves on 2 parchment-lined sheet pans, seam side down, then cover and proof. For spiral loaves, divide the light and dark doughs into 4 even-size pieces each. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into an oblong about 5 inches wide and 8 inches long. Take a light rye piece and lay a dark rye piece on top, then add another light rye piece and another dark rye piece. Roll this stack up and shape it into a batard, as shown on page 21, and seal the seam. Repeat with the remaining dough to make 2 loaves. Place the loaves on 2 parchment-lined sheet pans or in 2 greased 4 1/2 by 8 1/2-inch loaf pans, seam side down, then cover and proof."
"Recipe Name: Whole-Wheat Bread. Ingredients: 1 cup (4.25 ounces) coarse whole-wheat flour or other coarsely ground whole grains (oats, corn, barley, rye), 3/4 cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature, 1 1/2 cups (6.75 ounces) high-protein whole-wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon (.028 ounce) instant yeast, 3/4 cup (6 ounces) water, at room temperature, 2 cups (9 ounces) high-protein whole-wheat flour, 1 1/3 teaspoons (.33 ounce) salt, 1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast, 2 tablespoons (1.5 ounces) honey, 1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) vegetable oil (optional), 1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, slightly beaten (optional), 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, poppy seeds, quick oats, or wheat bran for garnish (optional), Instructions: The day before making the bread, make the soaker and the poolish. For the soaker, mix together the coarse whole-wheat flour and the water in a bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it at room temperature until the next day. For the poolish, mix together the whole-wheat flour and yeast, then stir in the water to make a thick paste. Stir only until all the flour is hydrated, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, or until it just begins to bubble. Then put it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day remove the poolish from the refrigerator 1 hour before making the dough to take off the chill. In a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), stir together the whole-wheat flour, salt, and yeast. Then add the poolish and the soaker, as well as the honey, oil, and egg. Stir with a large metal spoon (or mix on low speed for about 1 minute with the paddle attachment) until the dough forms a ball, adding more water or flour if needed. Sprinkle whole-wheat flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Add flour if necessary and knead until the dough forms a firm, supple dough. This will take 10 to 15 minutes by hand, slightly less by machine. The dough should be tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test (page 58) and register 77 to 81F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces (they should weigh about 18 ounces each). Shape them into sandwich loaves, as shown on page 81. Lightly oil two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pans and place the loaves in the pans. Mist the tops with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Proof at room temperature for about 90 minutes, or until the dough nearly doubles in size and is cresting above the lip of the pans. Preheat the oven to 350F with the oven rack in the middle of the oven. Just before baking, you may choose to garnish the loaves by misting the tops with water and sprinkling on sesame seeds. Bake the loaves for about 30 minutes, then rotate them 180 degrees, if necessary, for even baking. Continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes longer. The finished bread should register between 185 and 190F at the center and should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. The loaves should be golden brown all around and firm on the sides as well as on the top and bottom. If they are soft and squishy on the sides, return them to the pans and continue baking until done. When the loaves have finished baking, remove them immediately from the pans and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving. Enriched, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast Day 1: 2 to 4 hours soaker and poolish Day 2: 1 hour to de-chill poolish; 15 minutes mixing; 3 1/2 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 45 to 60 minutes baking Coarse flour weighs slightly less per cup than regular grind flour because it doesnt pack as tightly and contains more air. This explains why the coarse flour is only 4.25 ounces, while the regular whole-wheat flour used in the rest of the formula weighs 4.5 ounces per cup. The bread will develop a more open crumb if the flour is high in protein. The strongest flour comes from hard spring wheat, which can often be found at natural food markets that offer a variety of flours (see also Resources, page 291). You may also substitute regular whole-wheat flour from the supermarket. The use of oil and/or egg is offered as an option to tenderize the bread. If you use either of them, you will need to add additional flour during the final mixing. Let the dough determine how much flour to add, as you knead it to a firm, slightly tacky consistency. Another way to tenderize the dough is to use milk or buttermilk instead of water when making the poolish.

"Recipe Name: Warm Napa Slaw. Ingredients: 6 cups slivered cabbage (napa preferred), 1 tablespoon canola or corn oil, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, 6 medium green onions, sliced, 1 teaspoon bottled minced garlic or 2 medium garlic cloves, minced, 1/4 cup fat-free, low-sodium chicken broth or water, 2 tablespoons vinegar (plain rice vinegar preferred), 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce (lowest sodium available), 1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional), 1 teaspoon red hot-pepper sauce, or to taste (optional), Instructions: Put the cabbage in a large serving bowl. Set aside. In a medium skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Cook the sesame seeds for 1 minute, or until they begin to brown, stirring constantly with a long-handled spoon (be carefulsesame seeds will spit). Stir in the green onions and garlic. Cook for 1 minute, or until aromatic, stirring frequently. Stir in the broth, vinegar, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes. Boil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to about 3 tablespoons. Pour over the cabbage. Toss to blend. Drizzle with the hot-pepper sauce. Prepare 2/3 cup uncooked brown rice using the package directions, omitting the salt and margarine. Meanwhile, cut 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 4 ounces each) into slivers. Add them to the skillet after browning the sesame seeds and cooking the green onions and garlic as directed. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the broth, vinegar, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, stirring occasionally. Pour over the cabbage and toss. Serve over the rice. There are many kinds of Chinese cabbage, and they seem to have multiple names. Dont worry. You can use Chinese cabbages interchangeably. They are usually milder than hard-headed green cabbage, but even that, and savoy cabbage, can be used in this recipe. Napa cabbage has pale, crinkly green leaves. Its easy to prepare: Stack the leaves and thinly slice, starting at the tip end and working back toward the root end. The closer you get to that end, the narrower you should cut the cabbage. Then you wont have large bites of tough stem.

"Recipe Name: Chicken Pot Pie. Ingredients: One 2- to 3-pound chicken fryer, cut up, 3 celery stalks, 3 medium carrots, peeled, 1 large yellow onion, 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or stock, 1 chicken bouillon cube, 1/4 cup white wine, optional, 1/2 cup frozen peas, 1 cup heavy cream, 2 sprigs fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed, Black pepper, 1/2 recipe Thyme Pastry, recipe follows, 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) cold butter, 1 egg, 5 tablespoons cold water, 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar, 1 sprig fresh thyme leaves, Instructions: For the chicken: Start by putting the chicken in a pot and covering it with water. Bring the water to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes, and then remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool briefly. Shred the chicken with 2 forks, reserving the bones. For the stock, return the bones to the pot and boil for 20 minutes. Remove the bones from the pot and discard. For the pot pie: When youre ready to use the Thyme Pastry, remove from the freezer and allow it to sit on the counter to thaw slightly, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Begin by finely dicing the vegetables. Slice the celery stalks into narrow strips, then slice in the other direction to create a fine dice. Repeat this process with the carrots, and the onion. Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery. Saute until the vegetables start to turn translucent, a couple of minutes. Add 2 cups of the shredded chicken and stir to combine. Sprinkle the flour evenly over the vegetables and chicken, and stir to combine. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring gently. Pour in the chicken broth, stirring constantly. Stir in the bouillon cube and wine if using. The flour will combine with the chicken to create a delicious gravy. Next, add the peas. Pour in the cream and stir. Allow the mixture to cook over low heat, thickening gradually, about 4 minutes. Season with the thyme, salt and pepper, and remove from the heat. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. Be sure its adequately salted! Pour the chicken mixture into a deep pie pan or small casserole dish. Roll out the pastry so that its 1 inch larger than the pan. Place the crust on top of the chicken mixture and cut small slits in the top. Press the crust gently into the sides of the dish to seal. I dont worry about making a perfect edge on my chicken pot pie because a) it looks more rustic and b) Im lazy, hungry and I want to eat. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving. To freeze: Allow the filling to cool completely then top with the crust. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place in the freezer. To cook from frozen: Remove the pot pie from the freezer, brush with egg wash (1 egg mixed with 2 tablespoons water or cream) and place directly in a 375-degree F oven. Bake until lightly browned and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes. For the thyme pastry: Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Using pastry cutter, gradually work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles. This step should take 3 or 4 minutes. Lightly beat the egg with a fork, and then add it to the mixture. Next, add in the cold water and vinegar. Stir the mixture together until its just combined, and then remove half the dough from the bowl. (Dividing the dough in half results in two pretty generous pie crusts. If you desire a thinner crust, you may divide the dough into three crusts.) Place in a large plastic bag (do not seal) and slightly flatten with a rolling pin. This makes it much easier to roll out the crust later. After flattening, seal the bag tightly. Repeat with the other half of the dough and place the plastic bags in the freezer. I like to make several batches of pie crust at a time so I always have a crust ready to go. For recipes other than this pot pie, remove from the bag and place on a lightly floured surface. With a rolling pin, begin rolling the dough from the center, outward. Be gentle and patient; itll take a little time to get the dough completely rolled out. If you think the bottom is really sticking to the surface below, use a nice, sharp spatula to loosen it and sprinkle some extra flour on top. Then flip it over to finish rolling. Remember to roll from the center in single, outward strokes; no back-and-forth rolling. Again with a spatula, loosen and lift the pie crust and carefully lay it over a pie pan. Using your hand, lightly form the crust so that it fits inside the pan and overlaps the edges. Because its quick and easy, I just tuck the excess dough under itself above the rim. Then you can apply whatever decorative effects that you like to the edge. Or you can leave it plain if youd like! Just tell yourself its more rustic that way! Fill the pie crust with filling and bake according to the pie recipes directions. Or, for a pre-baked crust, fill with pie weights (or pinto beans placed on aluminum foil) and bake at 400 degrees F until golden, about 10 minutes."
"Recipe Name: Roast Pork With Apples - A Chefs Version. Ingredients: 400 to 500 grams Pork shoulder loin block, 1 tsp ... 1% of the weight of the pork Salt, 1 bit less than 2 teaspoons...1% of the weight of the pork Sugar, 1 (to taste)...about 5 to 6 sprigs Rosemary, 1/2 of a medium apple Apple, 1 as many (to taste) Potatoes, 1 as many (to taste) Tiny onions (or regular onions), 1 Garlic, 1 as many (to taste) Other vegetables of your choice, 30 to 40 ml Extra virgin olive oil, 1 A. Salt and pepper, 1 to 2 B. Garlic (crushed with the side of a knife), Instructions: Rub the A. ingredients well into the pork on all sides. Grate the apple skin and all. Add the sugar and salt and mix. Tie up the pork from Step 1 with the rosemary sprigs using kitchen twine. You can tie up the meat first, and stick the rosemary sprigs in later if you like. Coat the meat with the apple mixture from Step 2, and put it in a zip-locking plastic bag. Put all the liquids in the Step 2 bowl into the bag. Leave the meat to marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator. Take the meat thats been marinated for 24 hours (as per Step 5) out of the refrigerator about 1 to 1 1/2 hours before you are going to cook it. Adjust this time depending on the season and how hot it is in the room, as well as the size of the block of pork. Take the meat thats been taken out of the refrigerator out of the bag, and quickly scrape off the things on it. Leave it for a while on a rack or in a colander to drain off any excess moisture. Leave the meat as shown in Step 7 for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The meat is cold, so its brought back to room temperature so that it will cook easily. It will roast more evenly too. Just before the pork is roasted, wipe off the surface to remove the moisture and bits of apple. While the meat is resting as in Step 7, prepare the side vegetables. If youre only serving the meat, skip ahead to Step 12, then to Step 15... Cut up the potatoes to be the same size as the small onions. Cut up the other vegetables to be about the same size too. Put the olive oil and garlic in a cold frying pan, and cook over low heat to slowly transfer the fragrance of the garlic to the oil. When the garlic is fragrant and has changed color slightly, turn the heat up to low-medium, add the cut up vegetables from Step 11, and sprinkle on the A. ingredients. When the oil has coated the vegetables, turn off the heat and transfer the vegetables to a shallow tray. Put the pork in the emptied frying pan. *Brown the surface of the pork. If theres not enough oil in the pan, add some. Brown the pork on all 4 sides in order. Add the vegetables to the frying pan. Put in a preheated 180 C oven without a lid on. *The meat is turned over halfway through the roasting process. I use an oven-safe grill pan to roast the pork and vegetables, but you can just use the frying pan (if its oven safe) that you used in Step 16 instead. Whichever you prefer. After roasting the pork for about 45 minutes, take it out of the oven. * Turn it over at around the 25 minute point. After taking the pork out of the oven, immediately wrap it up securely in 2 layers of aluminum foil. Leave at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. Tip: Please be sure to do Step 20, resting the pork at room temperature. The pork will keep cooking with residual heat, and the meat juices wont flow out. Slice the pork in any thickness you like and its done. Serve with black pepper, rock salt, garlic oil, etc. - whatever you like. About pink-pork: This is entirely up to what you prefer. Since it is pork, I think its fine to cook it until its well done. This shows 480 g of pork shoulder roast thats been roasted for 45 minutes. We dont like pork that is any pinker than this in our house. This one is 450 g of pork shoulder roast thats been roasted for 47 minutes. The lighting when I took this photo is affecting the color a bit too, but I prefer the pork to be cooked to this level (vs. the level in Step 24). If you have a meat thermometer, if the temperature in the center of the pork is about 80C, it will be pink as shown in the Step 24 photo. This photo and the one for Step 25 show meat that has reached an internal temperature of 85C. If you cook the meat in a regular home oven for 40 to 50 minutes its fine. If the temperature of the center part of the pork is too high the meat will be a bit tough, but since it has been tenderized by the apple, you dont have to worry about it too much. The meat is tender and delicious without any special sauce. I serve it frequently to guests. About the side vegetables: In Step 20, after taking the pork out, cover the vegetables with a lid or aluminum foil to prevent them from getting cold. However, in the fall and winter when its cold the vegetables will cool down, so I recommend heating them through quickly just before serving them. You can adjust the seasoning at this stage too. The grilled vegetables dripping with the meat juices are quite delicious. The roast pork is delicious on its own, but I highly recommend the vegetables to go with it too. If you want a meat-only dish, and you dont have an oven, I recomment Sarettas recipe. From Step 17 on this one is great. Blocks of pork are inexpensive, but they are delicious depending on how you cook them.is \\""Roast pork\\"". For Christmas and special occasions, I make, \\""roast chicken\\"" made easily in a frying pan."
"Recipe Name: Chocolate Cake with Whipped Fudge Filling and Chocolate Buttercream Recipe. Ingredients: 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon fine salt, 2/3 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder, 2/3 cup boiling water, 2/3 cup whole milk, at room temperature, 12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), at room temperature, plus more as needed, 2 cups granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 3 large eggs, at room temperature, 6 ounces milk chocolate, coarsely chopped, 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped, 3 sticks (12 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature, 2 tablespoons whole milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon fine salt, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 1/3 cup light corn syrup, 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped, Instructions: Heat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle. Cut out 2 (8-inch) rounds of parchment paper; set aside. Coat 2 (8-inch) cake pans with butter, place the rounds in the pans, and coat the parchment with more butter. Coat the pans and parchment with flour and tap out any excess; set aside. Whisk together the measured flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl until combined; set aside. Whisk together the cocoa and boiling water in a small bowl until combined. Slowly whisk in the milk; set aside. Place the measured butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium-high speed until fluffy and light in color, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar and vanilla and continue to beat for another 4 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle with a rubber spatula. Return the mixer to medium-high speed. Add the eggs 1 at a time, letting each incorporate fully before adding the next. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle. Add a third of the flour mixture and turn the mixer to low speed, mixing until the flour is just incorporated. Add half of the cocoa mixture and mix until just incorporated. Continue with the remaining flour mixture and cocoa mixture, alternating between each and ending with the flour, until all of the ingredients are incorporated and smooth. Stop the mixer, remove the bowl, and stir in any remaining flour streaks by hand, making sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake them side by side on the rack for 15 minutes. Rotate the pans from left to right and back to front and continue baking until the cake edges slightly pull away from the pans and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out dry with just a few crumbs, about 15 to 20 minutes more. Remove the pans from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for about 15 to 20 minutes. Run a knife around the perimeter of each cake, turn them out onto the rack, and slowly peel off the parchment rounds. Let cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, make the buttercream and filling. Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low so the water is just simmering. Place the milk and bittersweet chocolates in a heatproof bowl large enough to sit over the water without touching it. Place the bowl over the saucepan and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside until cooled slightly but still pourable, about 5 to 10 minutes. Beat the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the milk and beat until incorporated. Pour in the chocolate and mix until completely incorporated. Add the vanilla and salt and mix until incorporated. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle with a rubber spatula. Turn the mixer speed to low and slowly add the powdered sugar until its incorporated and the mixture is creamy; set aside at room temperature. Meanwhile, make the filling. Place the chocolate in the bowl of a stand mixer (the bowl must be heatproof); set aside. Whisk together the cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Pour the cream mixture over the reserved chocolate and whisk until melted and smooth. Refrigerate uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooled to room temperature, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Place the bowl on the stand mixer and fit the mixer with a paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until the chocolate mixture is lighter in color and fluffy in texture, about 1 minute. Immediately assemble the cake (the whipped fudge filling will harden and be difficult to spread as it sits). Place 1 cake layer on an upside-down cake pan or serving plate. Working quickly, spread all of the whipped fudge filling evenly over the top of the layer, then place the second cake layer on top, top-side down. (If the whipped fudge starts to set in the bowl, stir vigorously until smooth.) Using an offset spatula or a long, thin knife, spread the buttercream evenly over the top and sides of the cake. (If the buttercream seems too soft, refrigerate until stiffer but not hard. You can save about 3/4 cup to use for additional decorating, if you like.) To make the decorative chocolate drizzle, use a dark marker or pen to draw 2 parallel lines 14 inches long and 4 inches apart on a sheet of parchment paper. Repeat with a second set of lines on the same sheet of parchment. Flip the parchment over, place it on a baking sheet, and place the baking sheet in the freezer. Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low so the water is just simmering. Place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl large enough to sit over the water without touching it, place the bowl over the saucepan, and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove the baking sheet from the freezer. Using a spoon, drizzle a thin stream of chocolate in between the 2 sets of lines in random patterns, making 2 (14-by-4-inch) strips of decorative chocolate drizzles. Return the baking sheet to the freezer until the chocolate is just set, about 5 minutes. Working quickly because the chocolate will get soft, carefully peel the chocolate strips off of the parchment and apply them to the sides of the cake, wrapping them around and pressing slightly to get them to adhere. Dont worry if the strips break, just press them onto the sides of the cake. (If the chocolate starts to soften, place it back in the freezer for a few minutes to harden.) Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days. If refrigerated, let the cake sit at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before serving."
"Recipe Name: Trifle with Strawberries and Caramel-Coated Bananas. Ingredients: Nonstick vegetable oil spray, 10 large eggs, room temperature, 1 cup plus 4 tablespoons sugar, 3 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup plus 4 tablespoons all purpose flour, 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, lukewarm, 1 1/2 cups milk (do not use low-fat or nonfat), 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, 6 large egg yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons all purpose flour, 1/2 cup chilled whipping cream, 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup plus 5 tablespoons water, Powdered sugar, 2/3 cup raspberry jam, 8 tablespoons dark rum, 2 1-pound baskets fresh strawberries, hulled, sliced, or three 10-ounce package sliced frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed, drained well, 8 medium bananas, peeled, cut into 1/3-inch-thick slices, Additional fresh strawberries, Additional bananas, Whipped cream, Fresh mint sprigs (optional), Instructions: Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly spray 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-inch jelly roll pan with vegetable oil spray. Line bottom of pan with waxed paper, extending paper slightly at short ends; spray paper. Using electric mixer, beat 5 eggs, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 3/4 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl until mixture triples in volume and is thick enough to fall in heavy ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 12 minutes. (This means there is enough air and structure in the mixture to support the flour and batter.) Sift 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour over batter in 2 additions, gently folding just to combine after each addition. (To help prevent the batter from deflating, ""fold"" the flour in by cutting into the center with a rubber spatula; slide it across the bottom of the bowl, then up the sides, bringing up some batter each time.) Drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons butter over and fold in gently (do not over mix or batter will deflate). Pour batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake cake until golden and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 12 minutes. Transfer pan to rack; cool cake. Repeat with remaining ingredients and another pan to make second cake. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover cakes with foil and store at room temperature.) Place milk in medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to boil. Whisk yolks, sugar and flour in medium bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk in hot milk mixture. Return mixture to pan; whisk over medium heat until custard thickens and boils, about 4 minutes. Strain into medium bowl. Press plastic wrap onto surface. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. Using electric mixture, beat cream in medium bowl to stiff peaks. Fold cream into cold custard. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Stir sugar and 1/3 cup water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; boil without stirring until syrup turns deep amber, brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan occasionally. Remove from heat. Add 3 tablespoons water (mixture will bubble vigorously). Stir until caramel is smooth. Pour caramel into medium bowl; mix in remaining 2 tablespoons water. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.) Sift generous amounts of powdered sugar over 2 kitchen towels. Cut around pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn each cake out onto prepared towels. Hold the cake in place, and gently peel off the waxed paper, pulling it straight back and almost parallel to the cake. Stir jam and 2 tablespoons rum in small bowl to blend. Cut each cake crosswise in half. Spread half of jam mixture over the golden sides of 1 piece of each cake. Gently press second piece of each cake onto jam. Cut cake sandwiches crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Arrange enough cake strips in 3 1/2- to 4-quart glass trifle dish or bowl to cover bottom, trimming strips to fit and allowing jam layer to show at sides. Brush cake layer with 2 tablespoons rum. Next, set up a decorative row of strawberries around the side of the bowl; then fill in center. Add banana slices to caramel syrup; gently stir to coat. Using slotted soon, remove banana slices, a few at a time, draining all excess caramel back into bowl. As with strawberries, layer half of banana slices atop berries, arranging some to show at sides of dish. Spoon half of custard over bananas, spreading to side of dish, using the back of the spoon to press the custard to the edge of the bowl in a clearly defined layer. Repeat layering with cake, rum, berries, banana slices and custard. Arrange remaining cake strips atop custard; press gently to compact. Brush with 2 tablespoons rum. Cover trifle. Chill at least 4 hours and up to 10 hours. Cover remaining caramel syrup; store at room temperature. Halve additional berries. Slice additional bananas. Arrange fruit atop trifle, leaving 1-inch plain border at edge. Brush fruit with enough caramel syrup to glaze. Spoon cream into pastry bag fitted with medium star tip. Pipe cream around fruit. Garnish with mint, if desired."
"Recipe Name: Brioche and Brioche Relatives. Ingredients: 1/2 cup (2.25 ounces) unbleached bread flour, 1 tablespoon (.33 ounce) instant yeast, 1/2 cup (4 ounces) whole milk, lukewarm (90 to 100F), 5 large (8.25 ounces) eggs, slightly beaten, 3 1/2 cups (16 ounces) unbleached bread flour, 2 1/2 tablespoons (1.25 ounces) granulated sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons (.38 ounce) salt, 2 cups (16 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature, 1 egg, whisked until frothy, for egg wash, Instructions: To make the sponge, stir together the flour and yeast in a large mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Stir in the milk until all the flour is hydrated. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 20 minutes, or until the sponge rises and then falls when you tap the bowl. To make the dough, add the eggs to the sponge and whisk (or beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment) until smooth. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, and salt. Add this mixture to the sponge and eggs and stir (or continue to mix with the paddle on low speed for about 2 minutes) until all the ingredients are hydrated and evenly distributed. Let this mixture rest for 5 minutes so that the gluten can begin to develop. Then, while mixing with a large spoon (or on medium speed with the paddle), gradually work in the butter, about one-quarter at a time, waiting until each addition of butter assimilates before adding more. This will take a few minutes. Continue mixing for about 6 more minutes, or until the dough is very well mixed. You will have to scrape down the bowl from time to time as the dough will cling to it. The dough will be very smooth and soft. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Transfer the dough to the sheet pan, spreading it to form a large, thick rectangle measuring about 6 inches by 8 inches. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and cover the pan with plastic wrap or place it in a large food-grade plastic bag. Immediately put the pan into the refrigerator and chill overnight, or for at least 4 hours. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and shape it while it is very cold. If it warms up or softens, return it to the refrigerator. If you are making brioches a tete, lightly oil or use spray oil to grease the fluted molds. Divide the dough into 12 to 16 portions for petites brioches a tete and 2 to 4 portions for larger shapes. (The size of each portion should correspond to the size of the molds; petites brioches a tete are typically 1 1/2 to 2 ounces each, while larger versions can range from 1 to 2 pounds. Whatever size you are making, the molds should only be half full with dough to allow for expansion during proofing.) Shape the petites brioches a tete into small balls (see page 82) and the larger ones into boules(see page 72). Proceed with shaping instructions shown below. Place the molds on a sheet pan after final shaping. If you are making loaves, grease two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch loaf pans. Divide the dough into 3 pieces and shape the dough into loaves. Mist the top of the dough with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap, or slip the pan(s) into a food-grade plastic bag. Proof the dough until it nearly fills the molds or loaf pans, 1 1/2 to 2 hours for petites brioches a tete and longer for larger shapes. Gently brush the tops with egg wash. Cover the dough with plastic wrap that has been lightly misted with spray oil. Continue proofing for another 15 to 30 minutes, or until the dough fills the molds or pans. Preheat the oven to 400F with the oven rack on the middle shelf for petites brioches a tete, or 350F for larger shapes. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes for petites brioches a tete and 35 to 50 minutes for larger shapes. The internal temperature should register above 180F for the small ones and about 190F for the larger shapes. The bread should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom and be golden brown. Remove the brioches or loaves from the pans as soon as they come out of the oven and cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes for small brioches and 1 hour for larger shapes before serving. Method 1: Dust your hands with flour and, using the edge of your hand (A), divide a ball of dough into a large and small ball by rolling down, but not quite all the way through, the dough. (B) Place the large ball into the oiled brioche mold and use the tips of your fingers to indent the top and to round and center the smaller ball. Method 2: Roll the dough into a strand that tapers at one end. (A) Poke a hole in the thick end and (B) loop the tapered end through it so that it pops out and forms a cap. Round the cap into a ball and center it on the larger portion. Place it in the oiled brioche mold. When a formula calls for lots of fat, whether butter, shortening, or oil, it is usually beneficial to wait until the gluten has had an opportunity to develop before adding the fat. If the fat is added at the beginning, it coats the protein fragments (gliadin and glutenin) and makes it difficult for them to bond into the longer, stronger gluten molecule. Wait 5 minutes before incorporating the fat to allow complete hydration to occur. Of course, there are cakelike variations of brioche in which the butter is intentionally added with the flour to create a very tender, tight-crumbed bread, almost like pound cake. If you desire this texture or application, simply add the butter early on and ignore the chill-down step, transferring the batter, with a spoon or spatula, to a greased pan right after the primary fermentation. To make brioche a tete, you will need a special fluted brioche mold, available at gourmet kitchen shops. These molds come in many sizes, but I find the small 2-ounce molds to be the most functional. The larger molds are nice for special holiday or festive breads like panettone. Remember to increase the baking time to account for the dough size. (All three brioche variations can be made as standard rolls; see page 82 for shaping.) The Rich Mans Brioche that follows is even richer than the version presented in Crust & Crumb. That one was about 70 percent butter to flour; this version is about 88 percent butter to flour. The yeast percentage is thus higher to provide the necessary push, and the sponge is very fast, needing only 20 minutes to develop. It is best mixed in an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, but it can also be mixed by hand with a sturdy spoon and a strong arm. Rich Mans Brioche % (SPONGE) Bread flour: 12.3% Instant yeast: 1.8% Milk: 21.9% (DOUGH) Eggs: 45.2% Bread flour: 87.7% Sugar: 6.8% Salt: 2.1% Butter: 87.7% Total: 265.5%"
