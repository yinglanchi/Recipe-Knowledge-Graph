Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups short-grain sticky rice, 1 1/2 cups shelled and peeled chestnuts (3/4 pound unpeeled), halved lengthwise (see Note), 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 5 sprigs cilantro, 2 cups canned low-sodium chicken broth, or as needed, 1 teaspoon salt, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped, 1 clove garlic, minced, Liver from the bird, yellowish membranes trimmed and chopped (optional), 1/2 pound ground pork, coarsely chopped to loosen, 8 dried shiitake mushrooms, reconstituted (page 332), trimmed, and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme or generous 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, 3 tablespoons Cognac, 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro, Instructions: Put the rice in a bowl and add water to cover by 1 inch. Let stand for at least 2 hours (or even overnight). To prepare the chestnuts, place them in a small saucepan in which they will fit in a single layer. Add the butter, cilantro, and broth to cover by 1/2 inch. Bring to a simmer, cover partially, and simmer gently for about 20 minutes, or until the nuts are tender yet firm and still hold their shape. Do not allow the nuts to boil, or they will disintegrate. When they are ready, some pieces will be intact and others will have broken apart. Set aside. Dump the rice into a colander and rinse under cold running water. Shake the colander to expel extra water and then return the rice to the bowl. Toss with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Fill the steamer pan halfway with water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. If you are concerned about cleanup and/or the rice falling through the holes of the steamer tray, line the tray with a piece of parchment paper or banana leaf, leaving a few holes uncovered for heat circulation. Pour the rice into the tray, keeping it 1 inch away from the edge where condensation will collect. Place the tray in the steamer, cover, and steam the rice for 20 minutes, or until the grains are shiny, tender, and slightly chewy. To ensure even cooking, give the rice a big stir with chopsticks or a spatula 2 or 3 times during steaming. Take care when lifting the lid that you dont allow any condensation to drip onto the rice and that you are not burned by the steam. At the end of each stirring, gather the grains back into a mound in the center, leaving a 1-inch border between the rice and the edge of the steamer tray. When the rice is done, turn off the heat and leave the rice in the steamer while you ready the other ingredients. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute for about 2 minutes, or until fragrant and soft. Add the liver and saute for less than 1 minute, or just until cooked through. Add the pork, pressing and poking it to break it up into small pieces, and cook and stir for about 2 minutes, or until half done. Add the mushrooms, pepper, thyme, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and continue to cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through. Remove from the heat. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish (or baking dish of similar size) with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Transfer the pork mixture and any juices to a large bowl and add the rice and Cognac. Use a rubber spatula or 2 spoons to combine the ingredients well, breaking apart any large clumps of rice. Discard the cilantro sprigs from the chestnuts and drain the chestnuts, reserving the liquid for a sauce or a soup if desired. Add the chestnuts to the rice mixture along with the chopped cilantro and mix together gently. Taste and adjust with more salt, if necessary. (The dressing may be prepared to this point up to 1 day in advance. Cover partially to prevent drying and let cool completely, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before baking.) Transfer the dressing to the prepared baking dish. Cut the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into bits and use to dot the top evenly. Cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake the dressing for 35 to 40 minutes, or until heated through and the bottom browns. Although the top will not brown, some grains at the edge will brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Chestnuts are in season in the late fall and early winter. Select shiny nuts that feel heavy for their size and store them in a cool, dry place. Be sure to use them while they still feel full and heavy. Or, freeze them unshelled for up to a year and thaw in the refrigerator before using. To shell and peel chestnuts, first cut a cross on the flat side of each nut with a sharp paring knife. To do this, place the nuts on a dish towel so they dont roll away. Preheat a toaster oven or a regular oven to 400F and place the nuts, cut side up, directly on the rack (use the middle rack of a regular oven) or in a shallow pan. Bake them for about 5 minutes in a toaster oven or 10 to 15 minutes in a regular oven, or until the chestnuts feel hot and the cut on each shell opens and curls. Carefully transfer the hot nuts to a dish towel, wrap them up, and squeeze the bundle to crack their shells. Working with 1 nut at a time and using the paring knife, remove the smooth outer shell and then peel, scrape, and/or cut off the papery inner brown skin. Use the knife tip to pry out skin bits stuck in the crevices. It is okay if a nut breaks during peeling. As you work, keep the unpeeled nuts warm in the dish towel, so the shells remain pliable and easier to remove. You can shell and peel chestnuts up to 3 days in advance of using and keep them tightly covered in the refrigerator, or you can freeze them for up to 6 months."}], "temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.5}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8yCePdR1sJTb8OZsJEtKUenEZIvql", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709359001, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```cypher\n// Ingredients\nCREATE (stickyRice:Ingredient {name: \"short-grain sticky rice\", referenceText: \"1 1/2 cups short-grain sticky rice\"})\nCREATE (chestnuts:Ingredient {name: \"shelled and peeled chestnuts\", referenceText: \"1 1/2 cups shelled and peeled chestnuts (3/4 pound unpeeled), halved lengthwise\"})\nCREATE (butter1:Ingredient {name: \"unsalted butter\", referenceText: \"1 tablespoon unsalted butter\"})\nCREATE (cilantro:Ingredient {name: \"cilantro\", referenceText: \"5 sprigs cilantro\"})\nCREATE (chickenBroth:Ingredient {name: \"canned low-sodium chicken broth\", referenceText: \"2 cups canned low-sodium chicken broth\"})\nCREATE (salt1:Ingredient {name: \"salt\", referenceText: \"1 teaspoon salt\"})\nCREATE (butter2:Ingredient {name: \"unsalted butter\", referenceText: \"4 tablespoons unsalted butter\"})\nCREATE (onion:Ingredient {name: \"yellow onion\", referenceText: \"1 small yellow onion, finely chopped\"})\nCREATE (garlic:Ingredient {name: \"garlic\", referenceText: \"1 clove garlic, minced\"})\nCREATE (liver:Ingredient {name: \"liver from the bird\", referenceText: \"Liver from the bird, yellowish membranes trimmed and chopped (optional)\"})\nCREATE (pork:Ingredient {name: \"ground pork\", referenceText: \"1/2 pound ground pork, coarsely chopped to loosen\"})\nCREATE (shiitakeMushrooms:Ingredient {name: \"dried shiitake mushrooms\", referenceText: \"8 dried shiitake mushrooms, reconstituted, trimmed, and chopped\"})\nCREATE (blackPepper:Ingredient {name: \"black pepper\", referenceText: \"1/2 teaspoon black pepper\"})\nCREATE (thyme:Ingredient {name: \"thyme\", referenceText: \"1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme or generous 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme\"})\nCREATE (cognac:Ingredient {name: \"Cognac\", referenceText: \"3 tablespoons Cognac\"})\nCREATE (freshCilantro:Ingredient {name: \"fresh cilantro\", referenceText: \"2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro\"})\n\n// Tools\nCREATE (bowl:Tool {name: \"bowl\"})\nCREATE (saucepan:Tool {name: \"saucepan\"})\nCREATE (colander:Tool {name: \"colander\"})\nCREATE (steamerPan:Tool {name: \"steamer pan\"})\nCREATE (skillet:Tool {name: \"skillet\"})\nCREATE (oven:Tool {name: \"oven\"})\nCREATE (bakingDish:Tool {name: \"baking dish\"})\nCREATE (aluminumFoil:Tool {name: \"aluminum foil\"})\nCREATE (rubberSpatula:Tool {name: \"rubber spatula\"})\nCREATE (spoon:Tool {name: \"spoon\"})\nCREATE (knife:Tool {name: \"paring knife\"})\nCREATE (toasterOven:Tool {name: \"toaster oven\"})\n\n// Processes\nCREATE (soakRice:Process {name: \"Soak Sticky Rice\", referenceText: \"Put the rice in a bowl and add water to cover by 1 inch.

Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and water in a bowl. Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion; stir-fry until soft. Dont brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds. Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15 seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10 pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each circle 18 inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker. If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it. Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb. Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Beat egg yolks with water and sugar; brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes. Makes 20 buns. CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked to the Western eye. Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4 cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk. Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a lightly floured board. Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the shallots, garlic, ginger, green onion, cilantro, thyme, red miso, soy sauce, reserved red wine, and the oil. Mix well. Add the beef to the mixture and marinate for 4 to 6 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare an oven safe, medium saute pan over high heat. Season the beef with the salt and pepper. Sear the beef for 2 minutes. Place the pan in the oven to finish cooking, about 8 to 10 minutes for medium rare. Take care that the beef does not burn as the marinade contains sugar. In a large saute pan over high heat, cook the shallots, garlic, ginger, and thyme, for 4 to 6 minutes. Add the chanterelle and cook for another 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine, then add the mushroom stock and the soy sauce. Set aside 1/2 cup of the mixture to be used in the risotto cake. Extract about 8 of the larger mushrooms to be used as garnish. Reduce the liquid by 1/3 and then puree the mixture in a blender. Add the lemon juice, canola oil, and truffle oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the chicken stock in a large pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep warm. Coat a large saucepan over medium heat with the olive oil. Sweat the onions and garlic, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the rice and saute for 4 additional minutes. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and reduce until almost dry. Slowly add the warm chicken stock allowing the rice to absorb the liquid. Stir the rice occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Keep adding the chicken stock until the rice is cooked al dente. Season with salt and pepper and add the reserved mushrooms, herbs, cheese, and butter. Spinach Roulade: 2 pounds spinach 3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 1 teaspoon sesame oil 1 teaspoon Korean chile flakes Salt and pepper, to taste Bring a stockpot filled with salted water to a boil. Quickly blanch the spinach and then immediately plunge it into a bowl of ice water. Strain the spinach from the water and allow to dry. In a mixing bowl, combine the spinach, sesame seeds, sesame oil, Korean chile flakes, salt and pepper. Place the spinach mixture in the middle of a 12 by 12-inch piece of aluminum foil. Fold the mixture to form a roll with a one-inch diameter and twist the ends of the foil to secure the spinach. Place the foiled roll in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Ingredients: 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, 1 cup lukewarm milk, 3/4 cup warm water, 3 tablespoons solid vegetable shortening, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, plus a pinch, 1 extra-large egg, at room temperature, 1 extra-large egg yolk, at room temperature, 1 package active dry yeast, Up to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour, sifted, Medium-ground cornmeal, 1 egg white beaten with 1 teaspoon water (optional), Sesame seeds, Poppy seeds, Caraway seeds, and/or, Toasted dehydrated onions reconstituted in a little hot water, Kosher or sea salt to taste, Instructions: Use some of the melted butter to grease the interior of a 5- or 6-quart mixing bowl. Set that bowl aside. Pour the warm milk into a mixing bowl and add 1/2 cup of the warm water, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, the shortening, salt, 2 tablespoons of sugar, the egg, and the yolk. Mix well. Dissolve the yeast in the remaining 1/4 cup warm water with the pinch of sugar and allow it to become visibly active, about 3 minutes. Add the dissolved yeast mixture to the mixing bowl and stir in enough flour, cup by cup, to create a somewhat stiff, shaggy mass thats no longer easily stirred. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the mass onto a floured surface, and knead it until youve created a dough thats smooth and elastic, adding only as much additional flour as is needed to keep the dough from sticking. Place the dough in the greased bowl and brush the top with more melted butter. Cover the bowl with greased plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm draft-free spot for 2 hours. Uncover the dough and punch it down with several swift swats with the back of your hand. Turn the dough over in the bowl and knead it gently to redistribute the yeast. Recover the bowl and let the dough rise again until light and billowy, about 1 hour. Line two shallow baking sheets with parchment paper and sprinkle the paper with cornmeal. If using one oven to accommodate both baking sheets at one time, place the racks in the upper-and lower-third shelf positions. If using a double oven, have the racks on the center shelves. Preheat the oven to 375F. If planning to apply a topping to the buns, make your egg white glaze and strain it into another bowl so its easier to apply. Place your seeds and/or reconstituted onions in small bowls, if using. After the second rise, uncover the dough and punch it down to deflate it. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly and gently. To shape burger buns, use your pastry scraper to divide the dough into 10 equal pieces and cover them while working with one piece at time. Shape each piece into an irregular round, then pull up the sides, repeatedly, pinching the gathered ends on top to form a small knot. Continue pulling and pinching until the dough is round and taut with a slightly pinched area on top, flouring your fingertips as necessary. Turn the ball of dough on its side and drive the blade of your pastry scraper down through the waist of the round (not through the pinched end), cutting the ball in half. Lay both halves cut side up, gently opening them so they lie flat. Sandwich both cut sides together, then pinch the cut edges together, sealing them shut. Place the squatty round down smoothest side up, and flatten it quite firmly, using your fingers to shove the pinched seam gently under the bun all the way around. When a bit flatter than you think appropriate, lay the bun (smoothest side up) on one of the prepared baking sheets and cover it with a clean kitchen towel while you shape the rest. Let the buns rise for 20 minutes, starting after the last bun has been shaped. To shape hot dog buns, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and cover them while working with one piece at a time. For each bun, roll a piece of dough into an 8-inch strand and flatten the strand using either a straight rolling pin or the heel of your hand. Roll both long sides of the dough in toward the center, and when the two sides meet in the middle, pinch them together to seal shut. Working with one end at a time, lift the dough at one short end and fold it over, rounding off that end and attaching that portion of dough to the seam, going about 2 inches down the length of the seam. Do this on the opposite end and pinch the dough, as needed, to correct the shape. When done, the seam should be straight and the bun about 7 inches long. Place the baking sheet horizontally in front of you. Invert the bun onto the prepared baking sheet, seam side down, close to one end of the sheet. Repeat the shaping procedure with the remaining dough, placing them in a vertical line, only 1/2 inch apart. (They should merge in the oven.) Tear off two large sheets of aluminum foil and scrunch each one into the shape of the buns. Spray them with vegetable spray and tuck these foil buns at either end of the lineup of buns, giving these last buns boundaries. If not applying a topping, cover the buns with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for 20 minutes, starting after the last bun has been shaped. If topping hamburger or hot dog buns, as soon as youve finished shaping them, brush the tops of the unrisen buns with the egg white glaze and sprinkle the tops with seeds or the reconstituted dried onions. Cover the buns with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for 20 minutes. If the remaining melted butter has congealed, rewarm it just until liquefied. Uncover the risen buns and brush the tops with melted butter (brush gently over the topping). Regardless of their shape, bake the buns in the preheated 375F. oven until they are golden and feel light, 25 to 30 minutes. If baking in the upper and lower shelves of the oven, switch the position of the baking sheets after half the baking time. Also, check the burger buns after half the baking and, if becoming too pointy in the center, use a flat metal turning spatula to gently push this raised section down a bit, taking care not to split the sides of the bun. When done, remove the buns from the oven and brush them once more with melted butter. Transfer the buns to wire racks so they can cool until just warm. Just before serving, separate the hot dog buns by pulling them off of each other. Serve the hot dogs and burgers with your favorite mustard and relish and a bowl of spicy ketchup, all passed at the table."}], "temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.5}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8yCeOt8dmVrSSDSw3jkp28iSO81E2", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709359000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "```cypher\n// Ingredients\nCREATE (butter:Ingredient {name: \"unsalted butter\", amount: \"1/2 cup\", state: \"melted\", referenceText: \"1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted\"})\nCREATE (milk:Ingredient {name: \"milk\", amount: \"1 cup\", state: \"lukewarm\", referenceText: \"1 cup lukewarm milk\"})\nCREATE (water:Ingredient {name: \"water\", amount: \"3/4 cup\", state: \"warm\", referenceText: \"3/4 cup warm water\"})\nCREATE (shortening:Ingredient {name: \"vegetable shortening\", amount: \"3 tablespoons\", state: \"solid\", referenceText: \"3 tablespoons solid vegetable shortening\"})\nCREATE (salt:Ingredient {name: \"salt\", amount: \"2 1/2 teaspoons\", referenceText: \"2 1/2 teaspoons salt\"})\nCREATE (sugar:Ingredient {name: \"sugar\", amount: \"2 tablespoons\", referenceText: \"2 tablespoons sugar, plus a pinch\"})\nCREATE (egg:Ingredient {name: \"egg\", amount: \"1 extra-large\", state: \"room temperature\", referenceText: \"1 extra-large egg, at room temperature\"})\nCREATE (eggYolk:Ingredient {name: \"egg yolk\", amount: \"1 extra-large\", state: \"room temperature\", referenceText: \"1 extra-large egg yolk, at room temperature\"})\nCREATE (yeast:Ingredient {name: \"active dry yeast\", amount: \"1 package\", referenceText: \"1 package active dry yeast\"})\nCREATE (flour:Ingredient {name: \"unbleached all purpose flour\", amount: \"Up to 5 1/2 cups\", state: \"sifted\", referenceText: \"Up to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour, sifted\"})\nCREATE (cornmeal:Ingredient {name: \"cornmeal\", state: \"Medium-ground\", referenceText: \"Medium-ground cornmeal\"})\nCREATE (eggWhite:Ingredient {name: \"egg white\", referenceText: \"1 egg white beaten with 1 teaspoon water (optional)\"})\nCREATE (seeds:Ingredient {name: \"seeds\", referenceText: \"Sesame seeds, Poppy seeds, Caraway seeds, and/or, Toasted dehydrated onions reconstituted in a little hot water\"})\nCREATE (saltTaste:Ingredient {name: \"salt\", referenceText: \"Kosher or sea salt to taste\"})\n\n// Tools\nCREATE (mixingBowl:Tool {name: \"mixing bowl\", referenceText: \"Pour the warm milk into a mixing bowl\"})\nCREATE (rubberSpatula:Tool {name: \"rubber spatula\", referenceText: \"Use a rubber spatula to scrape the mass onto a floured surface\"})\nCREATE (pastryScraper:Tool {name: \"pastry scraper\", referenceText: \"To shape burger buns, use your pastry scraper to divide the dough into 10 equal pieces\"})\nCREATE (rollingPin:Tool {name: \"rolling pin\", referenceText: \"For each bun, roll a piece of dough into an 8-inch strand and flatten the strand using either a straight rolling pin or the heel of your hand\"})\nCREATE (bakingSheet:Tool {name: \"baking sheet\", referenceText: \"Line two shallow baking sheets with parchment paper\"})\n\n// Actions\nCREATE (greaseBowl:Action {name: \"grease the interior of a mixing bowl with melted butter\", referenceText: \"Use some of the melted butter to grease the interior of a 5- or 6-quart mixing bowl\"})\nCREATE (mixIngredients:Action {name: \"mix ingredients in a mixing bowl\", referenceText: \"Pour the warm milk into a mixing bowl and add 1/2 cup of the warm water, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, the shortening, salt, 2 tablespoons of sugar, the egg, and the yolk.

Ingredients: Cocoa butter, Powdered food coloring as desired, 2 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered, 2 pounds white chocolate, tempered, Instructions: This technique can be used to make any painted design. I downloaded an image of a Mayan diety from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Allow the paint to dry. Make a raplette: I created a homemade chocolate spreader by using poster board and an X-acto knife. Since my painting is 10 by 16-inches, the opening I will cut in the raplette is 10-inches wide by 1/8-inch high. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely, simply peel off the acetate. Make the frame: Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Let the chocolate set slightly. Use a paring knife to cut 2 pieces of chocolate that are 16 inches long and 2 inches wide. Cut 2 more pieces that are 12 inches long by 2 inches wide. When the chocolate is set, peel off the acetate. Use a mitre box to trim all 4 ends to 90-degree angles. Just use a gentle sawing motion to cut through each piece. Make the cocoa pods: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many cocoa pods as you would like. Make the leaves: I found plastic leaves at the floral supply store. You can use real leaves if you make sure they are edible. Make sure they are clean and free of dust. Use a dry paintbrush to spread white chocolate on the face of the leaf. When the chocolate sets, peel off the plastic leaf. Now the leaves are ready to paint. I usually use green, yellow and red for leaves and always start with the lightest color first. If you want to paint the cocoa pods and the leaves, there are 2 methods. The first is to mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Then, follow the instructions to make a mold. The second method is to use an airbrush. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. Assembly: Use tempered chocolate to glue the frame pieces to the outside of the painting. Use more tempered chocolate to adhere the leaves to the frame and the cocoa pods to the leaves. Use vegetable oil to glaze the frame to make it shiny.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 2. Use a little coconut oil to grease the bottom of a baking pan, then lay the Tilapia fillets out nice and pretty. 3. Sprinkle a few dashes of sea salt on the Tilapia. This is not specified in the ingredients list, but its pretty necessary. 4. Mince the garlic cloves and transfer to a bowl. My husband and I are a garlic loving clan. Kind of a go big or go home situation. Feel free to cut back to 4 even only 2 cloves of garlic. You know, if youre into kissing or anything like that. 5. Add to the bowl of garlic: 1 tsp. salt, 1/4 cup lemon juice (if you can, use real lemons and squeeze them trust me), 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, and 1/4 tsp. each of ground black pepper, red pepper flakes, and cumin. 5. Mix until all ingredients are well-acquainted. 6. Spoon mixture over the Tilapia fillets. Be sure to dump any extra juices over the whole business as well we dont waste here. 7. Pop the fish in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes. Tilapia is fast, fresh, and easy. (At least, thats her reputation. Har har har.) While the Tilapia is cooking... Zucchini Instructions (Yes, both of my first recipes on here include zucchini. No Im not embarrassed. Not that much. What? I like zucchini.) 1. Melt 1 Tbsp. coconut oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat. 2. Slice up the zucchini. If youre feeling fancy, do it diagonally. (I could not be bothered with fanciness tonight when I made the meal shown in the picture above.) 3. Place zucchini in pan with melted coconut oil, add 1 tsp. sea salt, 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper and 1/4 tsp. coriander. 4. Do some stirring. 5. Cook the zucchini until just slightly transparent. Dont let it get mushy, because heaven knows nobody likes mushy zucchini. However, if one or two pieces get a little mushy in the sauteing process (like that top one in my photo), dont stress out.

Ingredients: 2 pounds skirt steak, 3 chiles de arbol, thinly sliced, 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper, 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, 1 tablespoon thyme leaves, plus 4 thyme sprigs, 1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, 1 1/4 to 1 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled, 1 bay leaf, 12 baby artichokes, 2/3 cup sliced shallots, 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, 1 bunch arugula, cleaned, Black olive aioli (recipe follows), Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 extra-large egg yolk, 1/2 cup grapeseed oil, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1 small clove garlic, 1/4 cup pitted black oil-cured olives, such as Nyons, 1/2 lemon, for juicing, Pinch cayenne pepper, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, Instructions: Trim the skirt steak of excess fat and sinew, if any (it doesnt usually need much trimming). Season the skirt steak with the sliced chiles, cracked black pepper, rosemary, and thyme leaves. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 400F. Toss the potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, the garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon salt. Place in a roasting pan, cover with aluminum foil, and roast about 45 minutes, until tender when pierced. (Depending on the size, age, and variety of potatoes, cooking time will vary.) While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the artichokes. Cut off the top third of the artichokes, and remove the tough outer leaves, down to the pale yellowgreen leaves. Using a paring knife, trim the bottom of the stem and the stalks. Cut each artichoke in half and remove the fuzzy choke if there is one. (If you clean the artichokes ahead of time, immerse them in a bowl of cold water with the juice of one lemon added, to prevent them from turning brown. Be sure to drain and dry them well before cooking.) Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Pour a cup olive oil into the pan, and wait a minute. Add the artichokes, and season with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Turn the heat to medium, and saute about 10 minutes, tossing often, until the artichokes are golden brown. (If the pan seems dry, add another tablespoon or two of olive oil.) When the potatoes have cooled, crumble them into chunky pieces. Squeeze the roasted garlic out of its skin and set aside. Wipe out the artichoke pan and return it to the stove over high heat, for 2 minutes. (To get the potatoes nicely browned and crisp, dont overcrowd them. You may have to use two pans or do it in batches.) Swirl in the remaining a cup olive oil and wait a minute. Add the crumbled potatoes, and season with the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Cook until the potatoes are crispy on one side. (Dont try to move them or turn them if they are stuck to the pan; they will eventually release themselves, just be patient.) After about 8 minutes, when theyve browned nicely on the first side, turn the potatoes in the oil, letting them color on all sides. When the potatoes are golden brown, turn the heat down to medium and add the shallots, artichokes, and roasted garlic. Toss well, and saute the hash together 5 to 6 minutes, until the artichokes are hot and the shallots are translucent. Toss in the chopped parsley just before serving. Light the grill 30 to 40 minutes before cooking, and remove the steak from the refrigerator so it reaches room temperature by the time youre ready to grill it. When the coals are broken down, red, and glowing, season the steak generously with salt, and brush it lightly with olive oil. Place the meat on the hottest part of the grill, to get a nice sear on the outside. Cook about 2 minutes, turn the meat a quarter-turn, and cook another minute. Turn the meat over, and move it to a cooler spot on the grill. Cook another minute or two for medium-rare. Rest the steak on a wire rack set over a baking sheet for a few minutes. Arrange the artichoke-potato hash on a large warm platter, and scatter the arugula leaves over the top. Slice the steak against the grain, and lay the slices over the potatoes and artichokes. Spoon some of the black olive aioli over the meat, and pass the rest at the table. Place the egg yolk in a stainless steel bowl. Begin whisking in the grapeseed oil drop by drop, as slowly as you can bear. Continue in this manner, following with the olive oil, as the mixture thickens. Once the mayonnaise has emulsified, add the remaining oil in a slow steady stream, whisking all the time. If the mixture gets too thick and is difficult to whisk, add a drop or two of water. Pound the garlic with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a mortar. Add half the olives and pound to a paste. Roughly chop the remaining olives. Fold the garlic-olive paste and the chopped olives into the mayonnaise. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, a squeeze of lemon juice, and the cayenne pepper. Taste for balance and seasoning. If the aioli seems thick and gloppy, thin it with a little water; this will also make it creamier. Season the steak with the chiles, pepper, and herbs the night before cooking. You can roast the potatoes and saute the artichokes ahead of time. Saute them together to make the hash just before serving; the hash can sit in the pan while you finish the steaks. You can make the aioli a few hours ahead as well."}], "temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.5}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8yCeP7TYKIaVp05q9sXkAf0DuyVuZ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1709359001, "model":

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "A recipe is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with heterogeneous nodes and edges provides a structured and semantically rich way to represent the information. In this context, the nodes represent entities such as ingredients, utensils, or tools, actions (e.g., chop, boil), and possibly conditions (e.g., for 5 minutes, until golden brown), and final product. The edges represent relationships or dependencies between these entities. The graph must represent intermediate states (like a output of mixing spices), optional steps, and recipe variants. The graph should model XORs (e.g., either use dry chilies or green chilies but not both, either bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes or broil on high for 20 minutes). It should capture 1) measures e.g., one cup of milk, temperature at 400 deg. F, bake for 20 minutes etc., and 2) conditions like \"fry until light brown\" or \"check for uniform consistency\". The graph needs to represent sub-recipes (like preparing a gravy) as a hierarchical subgraph. We need a separate set of FOLLOWED_BY edges between successive process nodes. Also for every process, we need a set of incoming PREREQ (for prerequisite) edges to connect ingredients to processes. We also need USES edges between process nodes and tool nodes. Further, for each node, add an attribute called \"referenceText\" where you identify the phrase from the original text that relates to the node or the edge of the graph. Produce the result using Cypher CREATE, MERGE and SET statements. Do not invent any ingredients, tools, or utensil nodes. Ensure the graph is connected. Also ensure each sub-recipe is a small recipe graph whose end node is the name of the sub-recipes. The sub-recipe end nodes must be connected to the main recipe.

Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups rhubarb fresh or frozen, about 1/2 lb. finely diced, 13 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon gelatin, unflavored unflavored, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup raspberries fresh, 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream well chilled, 2 cups raspberries fresh, 5 tablespoons powdered sugar, 7 ounces chocolate (semi-sweet) semi-sweet, grated, 2 ounces chocolate unsweetened unsweetened, grated, 1/4 cup corn syrup, light, 1 1/2 teaspoons rum or cognac, 1 x powdered sugar for kneading and rolling, Instructions: Place a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of your electric mixer in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. MAKE THE MOUSSE: Combine the rhubarb and sugar in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the rhubarb is very soft. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and puree. Transfer the puree to a medium nonreactive mixing bowl and set aside. Put 2 tablespoons cold water in a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over. Set aside and let soften for 5 minutes. Heat the mixture over low heat, swirling until the gelatin is completely dissolved and no grains remain. Stir the gelatin into the pureed rhubarb and allow to cool. Then fold the sour cream and berries into the puree. In the chilled bowl, whip the cream with an electric mixer at high speed until it holds soft peaks. Do not overbeat. Gently fold the whipped cream into the fruit mixture with a rubber spatula. Cover the mousse and refrigerate until it sets, about 4 hours, or overnight. MAKE THE SAUCE: Combine the raspberries and confectioners sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat until the berries are soft, about 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a food processoror blender and puree. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a small bowl and discard the seeds. Stir 2 tablespoons of cold water into the suace to thin. Transfer to a jar and refrigerate. PREPARE THE MOLDING CHOCOLATE: Put both chocolates in the top of a small double boiler over simmering water. Melt over low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula or wooden spoon until the chocolate is very smooth and shiny. Remove from the heat and add the corn syrup and liquor. Using a wooden spoon, mix the chocolate vigorously (the chocolate will start to \\\\\"seize\\\\\"; dont worry, be happy, youre doing just fine) until the chocolate gradually thickens and leaves the sides of the bowl to form a loose, soft mass. The stirring should take no longer than a minute; do not overwork the chocolate or its oils may separate. Divide the chocolate into 2 equal portions. Place one portion in the center of an 11 by 16 inch long sheet of plastic wrap on a cool flat surface. Level the chocolate with a spatula. Cover the chocolate with a second sheet of plastic wrap the same size as the first sheet. Using a rolling pin, gently roll the chocolate into a rectangle about 10 by 15 inches and 1/16 inch thick. Leaving the chocolate still covered, set aside at room temperature away from any heat source for 30 to 45 minutes to partially set. Repeat with remaining chocolate. When the chocolate is partially set, it should be no longer wet by still very pliable. If at first its still too wet to handle, let it sit for about 5 minutes more but do not allow it to harden or it will become difficult to knead. Remove the plastic wrap from one sheet of chocolate. Generously dust a work surface with confectioners sugar. Gather the chocolate into a ball. If the chocolate has dried out and cracks or crumbles a little, dont be concerned, the chocolate will soften and come togther again after kneading. Knead it briefly, pressing it into the confectioners sugar as you knead, until soft and no longer sticky. If it feels sticky, knead in a little more confectioners sugar. The molding chocolate should feel very soft and smooth. Divide the chocolate in half and shape each half into a ball. Cover the balls with plastic wrap and set aside. Knead and shape the remaining sheet of chocolate in the same manner, for a total of 4 chocolate balls. ASSEMBLE THE PURSES: Brush off any chocolate crumbs left on the work surface; the surface should be dry, or the chocolate will stick. Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with confectioners sugar. Slightly flatten one chocolate ball and gently roll it out into a circle about 9 inches in diameter. As you roll the chocolate, be sure to lift it from time to time and dust the surface underneath with a little more confectiners sugar to prevent the chocolate from sticking. Place one quarter (about 13 cup) of the mousse in the center of the chocolate circle. Gather the sides up to enclose the filling. Pinch the purse at the neck to seal in the mousse, allowing the top edges of the purse to fan out. Transfer the purse to a large platter, loosely cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Repeat rolling and filling the remaining balls of chocolate to make 3 more purses. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. TO SERVE: Place a chocolate purse on each chilled dessert plate and spoon some raspberry sauce around it."}], "temperature": 0.5, "top_p": 0.5}, {"id": "chatcmpl-8yCeP1jAvNTWJNKqBfqQ5q1nuReWj",
