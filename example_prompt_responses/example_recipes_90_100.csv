"Recipe Name: Basic Challah Dough. Ingredients: 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water (105F to 115F), 1 envelope dry yeast ( 1/4 ounce or 2 1/2 teaspoons); see Note, 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar, About 2 3/4 to 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, Instructions: Prepared By Hand: Challah dough is fun and easy to mix and knead by hand. As with all yeast doughs, the amount of flour needed to absorb the liquid varies with the humidity, the flours dryness, and the size of the eggs. But remember that bread dough is forgiving and works well in a wide range of flour to liquid ratios. Do try to keep the dough soft. Although firm dough is easier to braid, soft dough gives the lightest, most delicious bread. Use this recipe or follow this method for any challah recipe. Pour 1/4 cup of the water into a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over the water and 1 teaspoon sugar over yeast. Let yeast mixture stand about 10 minutes or until foamy. Stir if not smooth. Oil a large bowl. Sift 2 3/4 cups of the flour into a large bowl. Make large, deep well in center of flour. Add yeast mixture, remaining sugar, oil, eggs, remaining water, and salt to well. Mix ingredients in well with a wooden spoon until blended. Mix in flour, first with a spoon, then by hand, until ingredients come together to form a dough. Dough should be soft and sticky. Knead dough vigorously on work surface until it is very smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes; during kneading, if it sticks to your fingers, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough is no longer very sticky. Put dough into oiled bowl and turn dough over to oil all surfaces. Cover with warm, slightly damp towel or plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area about 1 hour 15 minutes or until doubled. Remove dough with rubber spatula to work surface. Knead dough lightly again about 30 seconds to knock out air. Clean bowl if necessary. Return dough to bowl, cover, and let rise again until doubled, about 1 hour. Shape and bake dough as desired (see recipes). Prepared By Mixer: Use a heavy-duty mixer with a dough hook for this recipe. It is the best and most efficient way to mix and knead large amounts of dough and to prepare doughs that are very sticky. Pour 1/4 cup of the water into a small bowl. Sprinkle yeast into water, then sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar into yeast water. Let stand about 10 minutes or until foamy. Oil a large bowl. Sift 2 3/4 cups flour into bowl of mixer fitted with dough hook. Make large, deep well in center of flour. Add yeast mixture, remaining sugar, oil, eggs, remaining water, and salt to well. Mix at medium-low speed, pushing flour in often at first and scraping dough down occasionally from bowl and from hook, until ingredients come together in a soft, sticky dough. Add remaining flour and beat until blended in. Mix dough at medium speed to knead it, scraping down twice, about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and almost cleans sides of bowl. Pinch dough quickly; if it sticks to your fingers, beat in more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until dough is no longer very sticky. If you add flour, mix at medium speed about 2 minutes. Dough should be soft, smooth, and elastic. Put dough into oiled bowl and turn dough over to oil all surfaces. Cover with warm, slightly damp towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in warm draft-free area about 1 1/4 hours or until nearly doubled. Knead dough lightly in bowl to knock out air. Cover and let rise again about 1 hour or until nearly doubled. Shape and bake dough as desired (see recipes). Prepared by Food Processor: I love making challah dough in the food processor because it is so quick and easy and produces very good results. In fact, the dough is mixed and kneaded in less than three minutes! Naturally, the amount you can make is limited by the size of your food processor. I use a medium-size (10- to 12-cup capacity) food processor to mix this dough, which is enough for 1 medium loaf. If you are in a hurry, you can skip the doughs second rising; the loaf wont be quite as light but it will still taste good. Pour 1/4 cup of the water into small bowl. Sprinkle yeast over water. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar over yeast. Let stand about 10 minutes or until foamy. Stir if not smooth. Oil a large bowl. Fit food processor with dough blade. Combine 2 3/4 cups flour and remaining sugar in food processor. Process briefly to mix. Add yeast mixture, oil, eggs, and salt. With blades of processor turning, pour in remaining water. Process until ingredients come together to form a soft dough; it will not form a ball. Process for about 30 seconds to knead dough. Pinch dough quickly; if it sticks to your fingers, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough is no longer very sticky. Knead again by processing about 30 seconds or until smooth. Remove dough from processor and shape it into a rough ball in your hands. Put dough into oiled bowl and turn dough over to oil all surfaces. Cover with warm, slightly damp towel or plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area about 1 hour 15 minutes or until doubled. Remove dough with rubber spatula to work surface. Knead dough lightly again about 30 seconds to knock out air. Clean bowl if necessary. Return dough to bowl, cover, and let rise again until doubled, about 1 hour. Shape and bake dough as desired (see recipes). Hand-Kneading Bread Dough: You can knead bread dough in a mixer with a dough hook or in a food processor. If you are making the dough by hand, there are two basic techniques for kneading it: the slapping method, used for soft doughs; and the conventional bread dough method, pushing with your palms. Since challah dough is quite soft when I knead it by hand, I prefer the slapping method, which I learned in France. With this method, you end up adding less flour and the dough stays softer, resulting in a bread that is more moist. If you are used to the conventional method or feel more comfortable with it, however, you can use it. Bagel dough is firmer than challah dough and works equally well by either method. Slapping Method of Kneading: With the dough on the work surface, place your hands next to each other on top of the dough, holding it lightly in your fingertips. Pull up the dough and slap it vigorously onto the work surface. Grasp the dough again at a different place, and repeat. Continue slapping dough, lightly flouring the surface if necessary to prevent excessive sticking, until the dough is smooth and elastic and holds together in one piece. Its all right if the dough is still slightly sticky but it should be much less sticky than it was before kneading. Be sure to handle the dough lightly and quickly so it does not stick much to your fingers. Conventional Method of Kneading: Put the dough on the work surface. Push the dough away from you against the work surface with the palm of your hand. Turn the dough, fold its top third down toward you, and push it again. Continue kneading the dough, flouring the work surface as necessary to prevent excessive sticking, until the dough is smooth and elastic."
"Recipe Name: Harlequin Soup. Ingredients: 1 recipe Very Green Broccoli Soup, 1 recipe Roasted Butternut Squash Soup, Fresh chives, finely sliced, 1 1/2 pounds broccoli, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons minced garlic, 1 cup (1/4-inch) diced onion, 1/2 cup (1/4-inch) diced celery, Gray salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves, 5 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth, 2 cups packed spinach, 2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon zest, 1 cup heavy cream or buttermilk (if using buttermilk, cut the lemon zest in half), Instructions: Ladle some of each soup into its own pitcher. Pour both soups simultaneously into each of 6 bowls, creating a swirled almost yin-yang like appearance. Garnish with chives and serve hot. Cut the broccoli florets from the stems. Peel the tough outer skin from the stems and trim off the fibrous ends. Cut the stems lengthwise into slices about 1/2-inch thick and then crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Heat the olive oil and butter in a soup pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and cook until light brown. Add the onion and celery, lower the heat to medium, and season with salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables slowly until tender, about 10 minutes. Regulate the heat so the vegetables cook without taking on color. Add the thyme and stir. Add the broccoli stems, stock, and salt and pepper, to taste, and bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for about 3 minutes. Add the florets and continue to cook until very tender, about 5 minutes more. Puree the soup in a blender in small batches. Add some of the spinach and some of the lemon zest to each batch and then puree it. (The soup can be made to this point, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat over gentle heat. Stir in the cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Chefs Note: When I plan on finishing a dish with the addition of a dairy product, as I do here with cream, I often add a dairy product early in the cooking, too, as I do with the butter in the initial cooking of the vegetables. It melds the flavors. Yield: 4 to 6 servings 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 cup (1/4-inch) diced onion 1/4 cup (1/4-inch) diced celery 1/4 cup (1/4-inch) diced carrot 1 cinnamon stick Sea salt, preferably gray salt and freshly ground black pepper About 4 cups chicken stock or canned low-salt chicken broth 1/2 teaspoon ground toasted coriander, optional 1 1/2 cups Roasted Winter Squash recipe 1/2 cup half-and-half, optional 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, optional 2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds, optional Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and cinnamon stick and saute until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken stock and the coriander, if using, and bring to a boil. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in the squash until smooth, then simmer gently to let the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick. Puree the soup in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with stock or water when reheating.) Return the soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add the half-and-half, if using. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm until service. Ladle the soup into serving bowls. Garnish evenly, with the cheese and pumpkin seeds, if desired. About 3 pounds butternut squash (preferably 1 large squash) Gray salt and freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh sage leaves 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 1/4 cup dark unsulfured molasses 2 teaspoons Toasted Spice Rub, recipe follows Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and toasted spice rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors. Pour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny. Working in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. Serving suggestions: Serve the puree on its own as a side dish for roast chicken, turkey, or pork; stir into polenta just before the end of cooking; use as a stuffing for ravioli; make into a soup; or use to flavor pastina. Or omit the sage, season with ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, and use as a substitute for canned pumpkin in your favorite pumpkin pie recipe. Variation for Smoky Butternut Squash: Cook the prepared squash on a baking sheet in a covered grill with soaked chips to give a slightly smoky taste. Substitute in any of the recipes that call for roasted squash. If cooking kabocha, acorn, or other difficult-to-peel squash, cut in half, scoop out the seeds, and rub the insides and cut edges with the vinegar/molasses mixture. Place on a baking sheet, cut sides up, and roast at 400 degrees F until tender. Scoop out and puree. Yield: about 2 cups puree 1/4 cup fennel seeds 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 1 tablespoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 1/4 cup (1-ounce) pure California chili powder 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Toast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Put mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze. Chefs notes: Toasting freshens spices, releases their oils, and makes them more fragrant, as well as adding a new dimension of flavor. Taste your chili powder before adding and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chilies are almost sweet, not hot. Yield: about 1 cup"
"Recipe Name: Chocolate Swan, Treasure Chest, Picture Frame, Chocolate Sleigh, and Dressy Chocolate Box. Ingredients: 5 pounds white chocolate, tempered, 5 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered, 8 pounds milk chocolate, tempered, Cocoa butter, Powdered food coloring as desired, Modeling chocolate, white, Instructions: To mold the swan: Use a ladle to fill a mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Depending on the thickness of the chocolate, you may want to repeat this step to make the swan thicker. Unmold the chocolate swan. When the chocolate has completely set, the swans are ready to fill with candy. To mold the treasure chest: Use a clean paintbrush or pastry brush to apply dark chocolate to the inside details of the mold. I painted the hinges and fasteners dark chocolate. Use a ladle to fill a mold with milk chocolate. Use the same molding technique as used in the swan. You can fill the chest with candy or any special treat. Tie it closed with a ribbon. To make the picture and frame: This technique can be used to make any painted design. I downloaded a clipart image from the internet. A simple design with a lot of color makes the best result. Place your design underneath a piece of acetate. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a fine-tipped paintbrush to trace the outline of the painting with a dark-colored paint. Use other paint colors to fill in the design. This will certainly remind you of paint-by-number. Use and airbrush if you want to give it an antique finish. Allow the paint to dry. Pour some white chocolate at the edge of the painted acetate. Pull the raplette through the chocolate pulling the chocolate over the painted drawing. This will spread an even 1/8-inch thick layer of chocolate over the painting. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to cut the paint canvas to the finished size of the painting. Let this cool until the chocolate sets. When the chocolate has set completely, simply peel off the acetate. Use a brush dipped in dark chocolate to brush a very light layer of dark chocolate over the relief of the picture frame mold. Use a ladle or cornet filled with white chocolate to fill the mold with white chocolate. When the chocolate sets, unmold the picture frame. The dark chocolate will leave an antique effect. Use tempered white chocolate to glue the chocolate canvas into the frame. It is ready for display. Make the sleigh: Make a template for the sleigh skis and the sleigh bottom. You can make this any size that you like. The bottom of my sleigh measured 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. I used a wood grain tool normally used in house painting to give the sleigh the texture of wood. To make the wood grain chocolate, pour a little dark chocolate at the edge of a piece of parchment paper that measures at least 11 inches wide by 17 inches long. Use a back and forth rocking motion as you pull the wood grain tool through dark chocolate. Be sure to spread this chocolate all the way to the edge of the paper. Repeat the process until the paper is completely filled with the pattern. Repeat on more parchment to create enough wood grain pattern for all of the pieces in your sleigh. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over all of the pieces that have the dark chocolate wood grain pattern. When cutting out the skis, use a paring knife to cut through the chocolate while tracing around the template. When the chocolate has set completely, remove the excess chocolate. When the chocolate is set, peel off the parchment. Make the sleigh handle: Roll parchment paper into a tight roll that is about 1/2-inch in diameter. Use a cornet filled with milk chocolate to fill the roll. Be sure to pinch the bottom to keep the chocolate from escaping. Set aside until the roll has set. When the chocolate is hard, remove the parchment paper. Use a hot knife to cut the sleigh handle to the size that will fit onto your sleigh. Assemble: Lay a ski pattern-side down on the work surface. Place tempered milk chocolate in a large cornet and trim the tip. Draw a line of chocolate along the edge of the sleigh bottom. Position the sleigh bottom onto the ski. Draw a line of chocolate on the other edge of the sleigh and position the other ski on top. When the chocolate sets, stand the sleigh upright. Use tempered milk chocolate to glue the sleigh handle into place. The sleigh is ready for any display. Make the Dressy Gift box: To make the strips on the top, you can use a tiling spatula with square teeth cut from it. My box measured 7 inches wide by 10 inches long. Use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered milk chocolate over a sheet of acetate. Pull the slotted spatula through the chocolate along the longest side. This will leave long straight lines. When the chocolate begins to set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over strips, being careful not to press into the milk chocolate strips. Let the chocolate set completely. To make the base, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. Use a paring knife to cut a rectangle that measures 7 inches wide by 10 inches. Then cut 2 strips that measure 61/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Cut 2 more strips that measure 91/2 inches long and 11/2 inches wide. When the chocolate has set completely, remove the base and strips. Use tempered chocolate to glue the strips onto the base to form a box. Place the strips just inside the edge of the base. Make the box decorations: Use white modeling chocolate to make the tie, collar, pocket and pocket square. I colored some modeling chocolate red for the pocket square. Get creative and have fun. Dust the work surface with cornstarch. Use a rolling pin to roll out the white modeling chocolate until it is about 1/8-inch thick. Use a paring knife to cut out the details of the shirt or blouse. Place the pieces on top of the striped chocolate box top. If you are inspired to do so, paint some patterns on the tie. When the chocolate has set completely on all of the pieces, the box is ready to be filled with any treat. Simply fill the box and cover with the top piece.

"Recipe Name: Reuben Dog. Ingredients: 6 Pastrami Dogs, recipe follows, 6 tablespoons salted butter, 6 Rye Split Top Hot Dog Buns, recipe follows, 6 ounces gruyere, sliced or shredded, 3/4 cup 1000 Island Dressing, recipe follows, 3 cups Celebration Slaw, recipe follows, 3 pounds beef short rib meat or chuck, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (at least 20-percent fat content), Ice, for placing in a bowl, 1 1/4 cups ice water, 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 tablespoon powdered dextrose, or 2 teaspoons fine sugar, 1 tablespoon ground pickling spice, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar, 1 1/4 teaspoons pink salt, such as InstaCure or Prague Powder 1, used for red color, or 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons crushed garlic, 1 tablespoon coarsely ground toasted coriander seeds, 1 tablespoon coarsely ground toasted black peppercorns, 1/4 teaspoon ground juniper berries, 2/3 cup nonfat milk powder or textured soy protein, 1 tablespoon liquid smoke, use if poaching, not smoking, the dogs, Special equipment: meat grinder with large and small grinding palette and chilled paddle attachment; 6 feet of hog casing or 12 feet sheep of casing, rinsed and soaked in room temperature water; butchers twine, for tying the dogs, 3/4 cup rye flour, 3/4 cup warm milk (110 degrees F), 1/4 cup onion, pulverized like an onion smoothie, 3 tablespoons honey, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, 1 tablespoon instant yeast, 3 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus more as needed, 3/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F), 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, slightly smashed, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, Nonstick spray, 1 egg white, 1 cup Garlic Mayo, recipe follows, 1/2 cup chopped garlic dill pickles, 1/4 cup ketchup, 3 tablespoons chili sauce, such as Heinz, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, Salt, 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 2 cloves garlic, chopped, 2 large egg yolks, 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup Garlic Mayo, recipe above, 2 tablespoons Creole mustard, such as Zatarains, 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 1 tablespoon minced fresh scallion, 2 teaspoons buttermilk, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Crystal or Franks, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 small jalapeno pepper, minced but not deseeded, 4 cups store-bought coleslaw mix, 1 fresh jalapeno, seeded and julienned, Instructions: Preheat a flattop griddle or barbeque grill to medium heat. Cook the Pastrami Dogs on the griddle or grill until the skin becomes very taught and slightly charred, without splitting. If the juice spills out, so does the fun. Spread the salted butter on each side of the Rye Split Top Hot Dog Buns evenly. Split the buns slightly, keeping the bottom intact. Divide the gruyere evenly inside the bun. Try to keep the gruyere on both sides; this is easier to do with slices, but you dont often find sliced gruyere. And gruyere is so, so good. Grill both sides of the buns until you get that \\""grilled cheese\\"" look: perfectly golden brown. Put the dogs in the buns. Top each dog with 1 tablespoon of the 1000 Island Dressing and the Celebration Slaw. Be blown away by the awesomeness that is the Reuben Dog. Arrange the meat in a single layer on a plastic-lined sheet tray or in a re-sealable plastic bag. Place the meat in the freezer until the meat is partially but not totally frozen, 30 to 45 minutes. I call this the semifreddo stage. Set a bowl within a larger bowl full of ice. Grind the meat through the largest grinding plate of the meat grinder into the non-ice bowl. Combine the ground meat with the ice water, kosher salt, dextrose, pickling spice, brown sugar and pink salt. Place the meat mixture in a re-sealable plastic bag and cure for 24 to 48 hours. Spread the meat onto a plastic-lined sheet pan. Place the meat in the freezer until the mixture is very stiff (semifreddo again), about 30 minutes. Set a bowl within a larger bowl full of ice. Grind the meat mixture and garlic together using the smallest plate of a meat grinder into the non-ice bowl. Mix the meat in the bowl of a stand mixer with a chilled paddle attachment until the mixture looks like stiff dough, several minutes. The temperature of the meat should be below 35 degrees F at this point. Add the coriander, peppercorns and juniper berries. Add the milk powder and mix, about 2 minutes. Add the liquid smoke if poaching, not smoking, the dogs. Boil a small pot of water to 200 degrees F. Test the meat: create a small meatball wrapped in plastic wrap. Boil the meatball until it reaches 140 degrees F internally, about 10 minutes. Taste the meatball to see if more seasoning is needed. The texture should be firm and springy, like a good hot dog. If the meatball is crumbly, you may need to start over. Sorry. Return the meat to a re-sealable plastic bag and refrigerate until stuffing time or begin stuffing straight away. Stuff the meat into the hog casings, and create links by tying off the casings with the butchers twine. Preheat a smoker or charcoal grill with a cover between 180 to 200 degrees F. Smoke the links in the smoker or grill until they reach an internal temperature of 150 degrees F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. If smoking on a grill, place the links on one side of the grill and place approximately twenty pieces of charcoal on the other side of the grill. The grill is ready to smoke when the lit charcoal is no longer ablaze. Monitor your grill carefully. If the internal temperature of the grill or smoker gets too high the links will cook too quickly. Alternatively, the links can be poached in 200 degrees F water until the internal temperature of the links are 150 degrees F. Transfer the links to an ice bath and chill until the internal temperature is about 100 degrees F. Combine the rye flour, milk, onion, honey, unsalted butter and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer using the dough hook. Allow to rest, 5 to 10 minutes. The mixture may not bubble much but it should start to swell slightly. Add 2 1/2 cups of the bread flour, the water and caraway seeds. Mix slowly at first and then on medium speed. Add 1/2 cup more of the bread flour and the salt. The dough should come together and have a tacky but not too sticky consistency. Add more of the bread flour, as needed, to get the dough where it just pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue mixing until the dough looks smooth, about 5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Turn the oven off 3 minutes after reaching the temperature. Spray the inside of a bowl with nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the turned-off oven. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. After the dough rises, remove the bowl from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Punch the dough and transfer to a work space. Separate the dough into 13 pieces, about 3 ounces each, using a bench knife. Use both your hands to roll the dough into tight, uniform balls. Make sure there are no air pockets in the middle of your dough balls. Roll each ball into 7-inch cylinders using both hands and rolling from the middle out. Make sure the cylinders are even in length or your buns will be wonky. Keep whatever dough you are not immediately working with covered loosely with plastic. Line a 15-inch-long, or longer, sheet pan with parchment paper or cover well in nonstick spray. Place each dough cylinder side-by-side up the center of the sheet pan, leaving 1/2-inch space between each one. Cover the pan with plastic and allow to rise until the cylinders are touching, about 15 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap. Combine 1 tablespoon water with the egg white and brush this mixture in an even coat all over the dough. Allow the dough to rise, about 15 minutes. Bake the dough until the buns are nicely golden brown on top and 190 degrees F in the center, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, about 20 minutes total. Allow the buns to rest in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the buns in one piece (thats very important) to a cooling rack to prevent soggy-bottom buns and cool, about 30 minutes. Transfer the buns to a cutting surface. Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife (this is the cool part). You will lose half a tube on each end, hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately. The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun. They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them, if you choose. Now you have a beautiful bread wall that you can butter and toast. Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use. Freeze the buns immediately if you will not be using them the same day. Yield: 12 buns and 2 slices. Combine the Garlic Mayo, pickles, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire, lemon juice and sprinkle with salt. Mix until a homogenous consistency is reached. Combine the lemon juice, mustard, salt, garlic and egg yolks in a blender or food processor. Blend on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until emulsified. You will hear a \\""slapping\\"" sound from the blender or food processor when the oil starts to emulsify. Blend the mixture until all of the oil is incorporated; the consistency should be that of a heavy mayonnaise. Use the mayo immediately or refrigerate and keep for up to a month. This recipe can also be made by combining 1 cup store-bought mayo, 1 clove crushed garlic and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Combine the Garlic Mayo, Creole mustard, light brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, scallion, buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, black pepper and jalapenos in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients until incorporated. Set aside. Any of this mixture that you do not used can be stored in the refrigerator, up to 2 weeks. Toss the coleslaw, jalapenos and Garlic Mayo mixture to desired creaminess in a large mixing bowl, about 6 tablespoons Garlic Mayo mixture to 4 cups coleslaw. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 cups."
"Recipe Name: Goat Cheese-Stuffed Chicken Breasts. Ingredients: 4 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, 3 ounces goat cheese, 2 teaspoons unsalted butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons minced chives, 1 teaspoon minced parsley leaves, 1/4 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, 1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic, Salt, Freshly ground black pepper, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon Essence. recipe follows, 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons water, 1/4 cup clarified butter or vegetable oil, Mushroom Risotto, recipe follows, if desired, Julienned carrots, accompaniment, recipe follows, Chopped fresh parsley, garnish, Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a chicken breast flat on a cutting board, using a sharp knife, about 1/3 of the way down the thick side, cut a deep pocket horizontally into the center of the meat about 3/4 of the way down, being careful not to cut through to the other side. (The pocket will be about 2 1/2 inches long and 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep.) Repeat with the remaining breasts. Wash hands well. In a small bowl, mash together the goat cheese, butter, chives, parsley, thyme, lemon juice and garlic. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Divide into 4 equal pieces and form plugs to fit inside the chicken breasts. Insert 1 into each breast and press the edges of chicken meat to seal. Lightly season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a large shallow bowl, combine the flour and the Essence. In another bowl, beat the egg with the water. One at a time, lightly dust the chicken on both sides with the flour, then dip in the egg, shaking to remove any excess. Place again in the flour and turn to completely coat, shaking to remove any excess. Set aside. In a large, oven-proof skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sear until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Place the pan in the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven. Arrange the risotto in the center of 4 plates and place the chicken to the side. Arrange the carrots along the bottom of the plates, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately. 5 to 6 cups chicken stock, recipe follows, or canned low-sodium chicken broth 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2 cup finely chopped shallots 1 teaspoon minced garlic 12 ounces assorted mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced, stems removed and reserved for making stock, if desired 2 cups arborio rice 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme 1 cup dry white wine 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 cup finely grated Parmesan 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley leaves 1 to 2 teaspoons truffle oil, optional 4 ounces prosciutto or Serrano ham, thinly sliced and cut into chiffonade, garnish In a medium saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce the heat to very low to keep hot. In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil and melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook, stirring until fragrant and soft, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, until wilted and their liquid is evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains are opaque, about 1 minute. Stir in the thyme. Add the wine and cook, stirring, until nearly all evaporated. Add 3/4 cup of the stock, the salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the stock is nearly all evaporated. Continue adding more stock 1/2 cup at a time as the previous addition is nearly absorbed, until the rice is tender and the risotto is creamy, 18 to 20 minutes. Stir in cream, 1/2 cup of the cheese, and the parsley and mix well. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste. If desired, stir in truffle oil to taste. Serve immediately, topping each portion with a sprinkling of the remaining cheese and ham. 1 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) chicken, cut into pieces, or 4 pounds assorted chicken bones (wings, backs, necks) 2 ribs celery, roughly chopped 1 large carrot, roughly chopped 1 large yellow onion, peeled and quartered 1 head garlic, cut in 1/2 horizontally Mushroom stems, optional 1 leek, well rinsed and roughly chopped, optional 3 bay leaves 2 sprigs fresh thyme Parsley stems 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns 4 quarts water In a large stockpot, combine all the ingredients and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours, skimming the surface occasionally to remove any foam that forms on the surface. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean container. (If necessary, strain again.) Remove the meat from the bones and reserve for another use. Discard the bones and vegetables. Let the stock cool completely, and refrigerate overnight. Skim any fat that forms on the surface. Keep refrigerated in airtight containers until ready to use, up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months. 1 pound large carrots, ends trimmed and peeled 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley leaves To prepare an ice water bath, fill a large bowl with water and ice. Set aside. On a cutting board, using a sharp, heavy knife, cut the carrots in half crosswise, then in half lengthwise. With the flat edge down, cut into thin slices. Place the slices in a stack and slice into even matchstick pieces. (If a fine dice is required, these pieces in turn are chopped into equal small cubes.) Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the carrots and blanch until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and shock in the prepared ice bath to stop cooking and preserve color. When ready to serve the carrots, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. When foamy, add the carrots and cook, stirring, until warmed through and glossy, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, sprinkle with the parsley and serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings"
"Recipe Name: Easy and Scrumptious Lasagna with Homemade Noodles. Ingredients: 200 grams Semolina flour (or bread flour), 2 tsp Olive oil (or vegetable oil), 1/2 tsp Salt, 2 medium Eggs, 300 grams Ground meat (your choice of meat), 1 large Onion, 1 medium Carrot, 2 clove Garlic (tubed garlic is also fine), 2 tsp Olive oil (or vegetable oil), 1 tbsp Consomme soup stock granules, 1 tbsp Soy sauce, 1 tbsp Sake, 1 tbsp Japanese Worcestershire sauce (or your choice of choice, such as tonkatsu sauce), 4 tbsp Ketchup, 1 can Canned diced tomatoes, 1 Water, 1 Krazy Salt (or salt and pepper), 500 ml Milk, 5 tbsp Butter or margarine, 5 tbsp Plain white flour, 2 tsp Consomme soup stock granules, 1 Salt and pepper, 1 Cheese (pizza cheese) easy melting type, 1 Dried parsley or your choice of herbs, Instructions: Prepare the dough first. Put the semolina (or bread) flour into a bowl, and make a well in the middle. In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, olive oil (or vegetable oil), and salt well. Pour this mixture into the well in the flour. Gradually incorporate the flour while mixing in the egg mixture. When the dough is more or less combined, knead it into a ball with your hands. Even if it is flaky and rough, its fine as long as it is collected into a single mass. Bring the dough together and flatten it a bit. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or put it into a plastic bag. Seal the bag or wrap well, and rest the dough in the refrigerator for 2 hours. While the dough is resting, prepare the bechamel sauce and meat sauce. Lets start with the easy meat sauce.... Finely mince the garlic and carrot, then chop the onion a bit more roughly. Saute the chopped garlic with olive oil (or vegetable oil) in a frying pan until fragrant. Add the ground meat to the frying pan and saute it until browned. Add the carrot and onion and saute well. Do this over high heat, taking care not to let it burn. When the moisture has cooked out, add the sake, soy sauce, and soup stock and continue sauteing. Stir in the can of diced tomatoes. When tomatoes are well incorporated, add enough water to cover all of the ingredients, plus the Japanese-style Worcestershire sauce and ketchup. Stir well, and continue cooking over high heat to reduce the sauce rapidly. Continue stirring while occasionally crushing the tomatoes with a ladle or a wooden spatula. When the sauce has reduced so that theres little liquid left in the pan, taste, and add the salt and pepper or Krazy Salt to taste! Adjust the seasoning to taste and its done! This is a simple and easy meat sauce. Now, lets make the bechamel sauce. Put the butter or margarine in a frying pan or a pot, and melt it over low heat. Add the consomme soup stock granules. Stir to dissolve the consomme soup stock granules in the butter or margarine. When thats done, add 2 tablespoons out of the 5 tablespoons of flour. Stir it into the butter or margine until it has melted in completely. Next, add 2 more tablespoons of flour and mix it in evenly. Add the final tablespoon of flour and mix it in completely. When the roux is blended, add the milk in several batches, stirring until smooth between additions. Continue adding until all of the milk is incorporated. Continue to mix away! When the sauce is smooth and creamy, its done! If you still have some undissolved lumps, add a little more milk. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. The easy bechamel sauce is done. It should ideally be rather thick. Dont make the meat sauce or the bechamel sauce too salty. The lasagna will be topped with lots of cheese, so it will taste fine in the end. After the dough has rested for 2 hours, take it out of the refrigerator, put it on a sheet of parchment paper, and divide it into 2 portions. Return one half to the plastic wrap or bag. Knead the other half a little to relax it. It will be quite pretty stiff, so press down hard! Knead the dough until smooth (on the surface), then press it out with your palms to flatten it a bit. The dough will be stiff, so you need a lot of strength...Press and roll hard with a rolling pin. Roll it out to a 1 mm thickness. Dont worry about the shape of the dough too much; just continue rolling it out until its 1 mm thick. When the dough is rolled out, cut it so its a little smaller than the casserole or lasagna pan youre using. You dont have to make it too exact! Just cut it approximately without worrying about fitting it perfectly. The cut off end pieces will be used later. Roll out the other half of the dough in the same way. Once the dough is rolled out, boil it. Bring water to a boil in a large frying pan or pot, and add about 1 tablespoon of oil. Mix the water and oil, then add the dough and boil it. The dough will float to the surface; the boiling time depends on the thickness and size of the dough sheets... For a thin and translucent noodle that floats to the surface, it should boil for about 3 minutes or so. If its 1 mm thick, cook for about 4 minutes, and its 2 mm thick or so, cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Ideally, for the most authentic results, the dough should fit the baking dish exactly! But thats a bit hard to achieve, so you can cut it in half to fit. Boil the cut off end pieces of the noodles, too. These will be used like puzzle pieces in the lasagna. The boiling times for the noodles are for reference only. To be sure, cut off a bit of the thickest part and test the cut piece for doneness! If the noodles are still floury and uncooked in the middle, they are done. Once the noddles are cooked, rinse them briefly in cold water and drain in a colander. Once you have the meat sauce, bechamel sauce, and lasagna noddles ready, preheat the oven to 250 C! Grease the inside of the dish youll be using to bake the lasagna with a little butter or margarine (not listed in the ingredient list). Start with a layer of bechamel sauce, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Add a bit more meat sauce than bechamel sauce! If you are using a dish of about the size specified here, you should be able to make about 4 layers total. It might be best to divide the sauce into 4 portions beforehand. Add a layer of noodles after the meat sauce layer! Repeat the layers. Even if the lasagna noodles are in pieces, you can fit them together like a puzzle without any gaps as shown. Since the lasagna noodles become thicker when theyre cooked; if you roll them out 1 mm thick as a base, even if the sheets are not perfectly rectangular they can still be used. Since this is an easy casual lasagna, dont worry about making it perfectly. Keep layering in the ingredients, from the bechamel sauce to the meat sauce. Top with the pizza cheese. Melting-type sliced cheese may also work. Add as much cheese as you like. When I added the last layer of meat sauce, my casserole was filled to the brim! If you add a bit less, leaving space at the top of your casserole dish, the cheese wont bubble over when its baked. Bake in an oven preheated to 250 C for around 15 minutes, keeping an eye on it until the surface is crispy and browned. When it has browned evenly on the surface, its done. Sprinkle with dried parsley to taste. Here is a view from the side... The cut side is also well defined. If you want to make more dough, use 1 egg per 100 g of flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of oil. The first time you make this, you might get slightly confused about some of the steps...so try it out when you have some time to spare. Its surprisingly easy to make. If your noodle sheets do not have an even thickness and the thicker parts float up to the surface as youre cooking them, open a few holes in the dough with chopsticks, and it will cook faster. The dough is so firm and chewy that you shouldnt need any flour for dusting, but if it looks like it will stick as you work it, use a little flour."
"Recipe Name: Healthy Mediterranean Pan Seared Salmon and Cous Cous. Ingredients: 5 ounces, weight Grape Tomatoes (or Cherry Tomatoes), 1 whole Zucchini, Sliced Into Circles, 1 whole Red Pepper Chopped, 23 cups Red Onion, Chopped, 12 ounces, weight Salmon Fillets (2 6oz Fillets), 1/2 cups Water, 1/2 cups Cous Cous, 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil, 2 cloves Garlic, Minced, 15 leaves Fresh Basil, Chiffonaded, 18 packages Fresh Chives, Cut Into Tiny Disks, Instructions: 1. Chop all your dang veg. Rinse your salmon and pat it dry. 2. In small sauce pot, put 1/2 cup water on and bring to boil. Add 1/2 cup of cous cous, stir quickly, cover, and remove from heat. It will soak up the water. 3. Forget about the cous cous for a second. In a large skillet over medium high heat, dump in those 2 tbsp olive oil. Let it get nice and hot, and then pop in your minced garlic. DO NOT LET THAT GARLIC BURN. Just let it get happy and fragrant. 4. Dump in your grape tomatoes whole. Toss them around with the garlic and let them heat up. Theyll start to burst pretty shortly and when that happens move on to step 5. If its taking a while and your garlic is threatening to get cranky I am not against squooshing them a bit with a fork. 5. Add your chopped onion and saute until it sweats. Take a deep breath because it smells good. 6. Add the red pepper. Saute everything until the onions start to get transparent. Flip it all around to get that juice from the tomatoes on everything. 7. Place a smaller nonstick skillet onto another burner and turn on the heat to the higher end of medium high. You want to let that pan heat up. Leave it alone and go back to your veg. 8. When the onions get floppy and translucent, add your sliced zucchini. Stir it all around. 9. Turn down the heat to just below medium (medium low?) and cover the skillet. The juice from the tomatoes will simmer into everything and it will be good. 10. Remember that pan? That hot one over there? Place your salmon fillets in it, skin side down. Watch out, theyll sizzle. DONT WORRY it is not too hot. Salmon can take it; its a tough fish. 11. You have to use your eyes for this. Cook the salmon skin side down until it is light pink halfway up the side. Youll see it! At that point, gently loosen the salmon with a spatula and flip it over. The skin will be a nice pretty brown. 12. While it cooks the second side, remove the skin carefully with a very sharp paring knife. Youll see where its connected to the flesh; just make little sawing motions underneath, keeping the flat of the knife parallel to the pan. That salmon is probably spitting some liquid. Be careful not to get spattered. Use a long fork to hold it if you have to. 13. Keep an eye on your fish. It will need about 4 minutes after you flip it to get to medium rare, 5 or six to get to medium. After removing the skin and making sure its been the required time for doneness since you flipped it, FLIP IT AGAIN. This is a flip just to sear the now naked previously skinned side. It also lets you get up in there to check doneness. Dont let it cook after the second flip too long. 14. Take a fork and poke it in over the thickest part of the fish. Turn the fork slightly. If the fish is opaque, its done. It doesnt have to be nearly white unless thats how you like it. You could also forgo the forking and make the OK sign with one hand. Poke that bump of muscle under your thumb and feel the muscle. Now poke the fish. They should feel the same. If you have no idea what Im talking about, use the fork, Luke. Remove from heat and let rest for a sec. 15. Dump your chiffonade of basil into your veg. Dump your chives in too. Give them a stir. Yumm. 16. Time to assemble! Remember that cous cous? Take the cover off and fluff it with a fork. Dump it into the tomatoey veg concoction and stir it up. I really just like the cous cous for texture, so it wont look like theres much in there but it will be good. Spoon a ton of that goodness onto plates. 17. Lay your fillet on top of that delicious mound. Serve with a glass of chardonnay if youre feeling fancy. If youd rather red, I would go with a pinot noir. 18. Eat that thing."
"Recipe Name: Cute Little Red Riding Hood Icebox Cookies. Ingredients: 340 grams Cake flour, 100 grams Raw cane sugar, 180 grams Unsalted butter, 1 Egg yolk, 1 pinch Salt, 5 drops off a toothpick Food coloring (red), 1 tbsp Cocoa powder (unsweetened), 1 White sesame and black sesame, 1 Decoration chocolate, Instructions: Warm the butter to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave at 600 W for 30-40 seconds to soften (adjust to your microwave strength to make sure not to let it melt too much). Whip into a cream. Add the light brown sugar in 2-3 batches, blending it into the butter with each addition. Stir in the light brown sugar, add the egg yolk, then evenly combine. Mix well. Sift in the cake flour. Switch to a rubber spatula and mix with a cutting motion. Continue until the dough becomes crumbly and smooth, as shown. Divide the dough into 4 portions. You should have close to 548 g, so each portion should be about 138 g. The weight may vary slightly depending on the amount of sugar and the size of the egg. Color one portion with food coloring. As shown, I added the amount that clung to a toothpick 5 times. Color the other portion with cocoa powder. Mix the colored dough separately with a rubber spatula with a cutting motion, and it should slowly come together into a ball. There should now be red, brown, white \\""A\\"", and white \\""B\\"" balls of dough. Use the red dough for Little Red Riding Hood. With the brown dough, use 3/4 for the wolfs face, 1/8 for the wolfs body, and 1/8 for Little Red Riding Hoods hair. With the white dough \\""A\\"", use 2/3 for Little Red Riding Hoods face, and 1/3 for the border around her head. Use white dough \\""B\\"" for the border around the wolfs head. Roll the dough for Little Red Riding Hoods face into a long log. It should be slightly ovular. Roll 3/4 of the brown dough for the wolfs face into a slightly squarish ovular log, and place into the freezer. Let sit for approximately 20 minutes, and transfer to the fridge after 20 minutes. Make Little Red Riding Hood while the wolfs face is chilling. Roll 1/8 of the brown dough long and thin for Little Red Riding Hoods hair. Stick it in the freezer for about 5 minutes. Doing so will make the dough easier to handle. Take it out of the freezer, and make an indentation in the side to inlay the dough for the hair. Cut the dough for the hair in half. I made two groves on the side. The dough will fall apart if you press down too firmly on the dough. But if it falls apart, gently press the parts back together. Arrange the dough for the hair on top of the dough for the face as shown. Wrap the dough in parchment paper, and roll it to seal any gaps. The face is done. Let it sit in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then transfer it to the fridge. Take the dough for the wolfs face out of the freezer. It may break apart if you freeze it for too long, so transfer it to the fridge after 20 minutes to make shaping easier. Make a slit halfway through the dough as shown. Cut into the dough once more at a diagonal to cut out a narrow triangular stick. Cut into the same part to make 2 of these. These will be the wolfs ears. The cut element will become the mouth. This is how it should look. Freeze the dough for the wolfs face in the freezer for a while. Take out the dough for Little Red Riding Hoods face, and roll out the red dough to the same length as the face. It should be about 2 mm thick. Roll out white dough \\""B\\"" to wrap around the wolfs head to the same size as the dough for the wolfs face. It should be about 3 mm thick. As shown in Steps 31 and 32, fold parchment paper around the edges of the dough, then roll it out for a tidy edge. Let it sit in the freezer for 5 minutes. Cut the dough to fit around the wolfs face. One strand for between the ears... ...and one for inside the mouth. Fill the space on both sides of the ears as well. Press down on it to fill in the gaps. Use 1/8 of the brown dough for the wolfs body, and shape it into a square log. Store in the freezer. Now make Little Red Riding Hoods cape. Place the dough for her face on top of red dough cut to the width shown. Since the dough is chilled, it should be easy to handle. Cut the dough with a knife and make the hood as shown. Roll the dough in parchment paper, maintaining the triangular shape of the hood on top. Shape the sides of the face with your fingertips. Roll the bottom of the dough back and forth to adjust the shape of the face. Press down on the triangular part of the hood with the side of a box of plastic wrap or aluminum foil to make a perfect triangle. Now the dough has come together nicely. Chill it in the freezer. Take the dough for the wolfs head and body out of the freezer, and flip it upside down. Since it should be rock hard from freezing, the ears shouldnt get damaged from the weight. Pack the white dough against the sides of the body as well... ...then wrap it up in the remaining white dough. Prevent any gaps by pressing down firmly and adjusting the shape, then store in the freezer. Transfer the dough from the freezer to the fridge after 20 minutes. Take dough for Little Red Riding Hood out of the freezer, roll out 1/3 of white dough \\""A\\"", then wrap it around the red dough. Press the dough together with parchment paper after rolling. Adjust the shape, then stick the dough in the freezer. Cut the wolf dough into 5 mm thick slices. Preheat the oven to 180C. It should be solid enough to slice from chilling, but if it seems soft, stick the dough in the freezer and keep an eye on it. Arrange the cookies on a baking tray and stick on sesame seeds with the pointed ends angled downwards to give the wolf angry eyes. Refer tofor how to stick on the sesame. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C for 17 minutes. Adjust the cooking time according to your oven. Open up the oven about 8 minutes after baking, and cover with aluminum foil to keep the cookies from over-baking. The wolves are done baking. Cut the Little Red Riding Hood cookies into 5 mm slices as well. Use black sesame for Little Red Riding Hoods eyes. Its also cute to bake without the sesame, then use chocolate to draw various faces. Bake along with the wolves. (See Steps 55 and 56.) Proceed with decoration after baking and cooling completely. You can make a grannie wolf by drawing on glasses and a hair bonnet with white chocolate. Draw a cute little mouth on Little Red Riding Hood with chocolate. They are done. Wrap them up after the chocolate has set completely."
"Recipe Name: My Secret Chocolate Cake. Ingredients: 3 Egg whites (large), 120 grams Granulated sugar, 3 Egg yolks (large), 80 grams Cake flour, 50 ml Milk, 30 grams Butter (or margarine), 20 grams Cocoa powder, 200 ml Fresh cream (see Step 40), 200 grams Sweet chocolate (see Step 41), 1 (Optional: liqueur - see Step 42), 1 Cocoa powder, Instructions: Preparation: Line a cake tin with parchment paper (or you can use wrapping paper!) If the paper wont stay on the bottom of the tin, spread oil on the tin first and then the paper will stick to it. Keep the eggs in the refrigerator until you need them. Apparently, they whip up better that way! Put the egg whites in a bowl and break it up with a handheld mixer. Please be sure to use a clean bowl. If theres any oil or moisture on it, the egg whites wont whip up! When the air bubbles in the egg whites are even, add half the sugar and keep beating. When its fluffy add the rest of the sugar, and keep beating until you have a finely textured, shiny meringue. If peaks form on the meringue when you take out the handheld mixer, its good! Add egg yolks to the meringue. Incorporate them well. Sift the cake flour into the batter, and fold it in with a rubber spatula, scooping up from the bottom. Use a cut-and-fold motion while turning the bowl. Dont knead the batter whatever you do! Put butter and milk in a heatproof bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and microwave for a minute and a half. You can heat it in a small pot too. When its warmed through, sift in cocoa powder using a tea strainer and dissolve. Its an extra step, but be sure to use the strainer! Mix well until the cocoa powder has completely dissolved! Make sure there are no lumps. Add the Step 9 mixture to the bowl in Step 6 little by little (if you add it all at once the cocoa powder and butter will sink to the bottom.) Mix in quickly, scooping up the batter from the bottom while turning the bowl. Dont knead the batter during this step either. Pour the batter into the lined cake tin. The batter stuck to the bowl doesnt rise well, so pour it around the perimeter of the tin where it will bake faster. Drop the tin from a height onto the work surface 4 to 5 times to eliminate any air pockets, then smooth out the surface. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in a preheated 170C oven. When a bamboo skewer poked in the middle comes out clean, its done! As soon as it comes out of the oven, drop the cake tin onto a work surface from a 30 cm height, to prevent the spongecake from shrinking. Put a tightly wrung out moist kitchen towel on your work surface, and take the spongecake out of the tin. Place the cake bottom side up and peel off the paper. Invert the cake tin over the cake again, and leave for 2 to 3 minutes. This is to flatten out the surface, and also to distribute the moisture in the cake evenly. Remove the tin and paper off. Invert the cake and place on a cooling rack. Cover with a tightly wrung out kitchen towel and leave to cool. When the spongecake has cooled, slice into 3 even pieces horizontally. Its easier to slice after letting it rest for a day. Store in a plastic bag to prevent it from drying out. How to slice the spongecake cleanly: Mark the sides vertically with a knife so that you can re-stack the layers later. If you dont have a cake slicer: Insert toothpicks where you want to slice through the cake, starting with the upper layer, spacing the toothpicks evenly (in 4 to 8 places). Slice through the cake on top of the toothpicks horizontally. Slice the lower layer in the same way. Re-stack the layers, following the vertical marks you made in Step 19. Tip: If you flip the bottom layer over, put the middle layer on top, and the top layer in the middle, the cake will be easier to decorate. Make the chocolate cream: Put the cream in a small pot, and heat over a low flame. When it has warmed take it off the heat (it should just be bubbling around the edges!) Add the finely chopped chocolate and stir to melt. Stir the cream and chocolate to melt. When it has cooled down a bit, optionally add a little liqueur. See Step 42. You can make hot chocolate with the chocolate left in the pan. See. Put the bottom of the pan in a bowl of ice water, and let it cool down while stirring with a whisk until the chocolate cream is thick enough to use as icing. You could beat the cream if you like too. Spread plenty of the chocolate cream on the cut sides of the sponge cake from Step 23! Be very generous! The cake will become very moist. Lots of cream. Spread the chocolate cream on the top and sides too, and were 90% done. When the chocolate cream has firmed. If it doesnt firm up fast enough, put the cake in the refrigerator, dust the cake with cocoa powder through a tea strainer. To dust the sides, lift the cake up and hold it diagonally as you dust. When the chocolate cream has firmed up again, slice the cake and serve. Dip your knife in hot water and wipe off the moisture to cut the cake cleanly. The cake keeps for 2 to 3 days. Its great the day its made, but is even more delicious the next day! The chocolate cream melds with the spongecake, and its moist and sublime! To store the cake: Cover loosely with plastic wrap and keep at room temperature. Use a cake box or even a paper bag! In the summer, store in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator. To make a 12 cm diameter cake: Use 1/2 the ingredients of the 18 cm cake. Here I decorated the sides with a box of chocolate twigs. (4 twigs x 12 bags = 48) To make a 15 cm diameter cake: Halve the amount of ingredients used for the 20 cm cake. I decorated with this cake with hearts, which I was inspired by. To make a 21 cm diameter cake: Recalculate the amounts based on 5 eggs Or multiply the amounts for the 18 cm cake by 1.5. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes. The cake here is decorated on the sides with biscottes (light crispy cookies). To make a 12 cm diameter cake plus a 15 cm diameter cake: Use the amount of ingredients specified for the 18 cm or 20 cm cakes (I prefer the latter). Baking time is about 30 to 35 minutes. This cake is decorated on the sides with almond praline and macarons. To make mini-cakes: Cut the spongecake with a 5.5 cm circular cutter to make mini-cakes. These cakes are rolled on the sides in crushed almond praline. For a tin with 500 ml capacity, calculate the ingredient amounts needed for 1 egg. On fresh cream: Animal or vegetable based heavy cream is OK, as is whipping cream. Coffee cream or coffee creamer is not OK. On chocolate: You can use sweet baking chocolate, regular chocolate bars (milk or dark, whichever you prefer) or bite sized chocolates (bulk packs) etc. On liqueurs: Try adding 1 teaspoon of rum and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of brandy to the basic chocolate cream. More on liqueurs: In Step 27, before spreading the chocolate cream, try sprinkling a little liqueur on the cut sides of the sponge cake. It will make the cake very fragrant and grown-up."
