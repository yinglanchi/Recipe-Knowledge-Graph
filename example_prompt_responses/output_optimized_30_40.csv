"Recipe Name: Christmas Tree Cake. Ingredients: 1 refer to the memo Chiffon Spongecake (2 sheets), 6 Egg yolks, 120 grams Sugar, 400 ml Milk, 30 grams Flour, 1 dash Vanilla extract, 2 tsp Kirsch, 1 pack Strawberries (for the filling), 2 packs Strawberries (for the decorating), 2 Kiwi, 2 Oranges, 200 ml Heavy cream, 20 grams Sugar, 1 Vanilla extract, 200 ml Heavy cream, 20 grams Sugar, 1 Vanilla extract, Instructions: Make the mold... Using construction paper or any thick paper, staple and tape to form a cone with a height of 26 cm and diameter of 18 cm. Fit a piece of baking paper to the size of the mold and insert. Stand the cone in a milk carton to work. Bake the spongecake... Use any recipe you like. (The baking sheet should be 24 x 27 cm). After the cake is baked, peel off and remove the browned parts. Make the custard creme: In a bowl, add egg yolks and sugar. Use a whisk and beat well until white. Next, add the powdered ingredients and mix. Add 2 tablespoons of milk from the quantity listed above, and mix. Heat the rest of the milk until just before it starts to boil and add bit by bit to the bowl. Return the mixture to a pot through a strainer. Over medium heat, use a wooden spatula to continuously mix. (1-2 minutes after it begins to boil.) Pour into the bowl and wrap. (Tightly wrap the cream! Cover the cream with plastic wrap). Once its cooled, change the bowl and, using a whisk, whip in the vanilla extract and Kirsch. Fruit... Cut each fruit into bite-sized pieces. The strawberries are fine whole! Absorb the excess moisture with a paper towel and set aside. For the filling creme, whip together the ingredients marked . Construction... Cut and fit the spongecake into the mold. Cut the remaining cake into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Fill the cake from Step 11 with the fruit, cut pieces of cake, custard creme, and filling creme, making sure they are nicely balanced. Lastly, top with sponge cake to finish and push lightly with your hands. Keeping the milk carton in place, drop 2 or 3 times from a height of about 20 cm to settle the filling. Tightly wrap and cool completely in the refrigerator. (I cooled it for 9 hours this time.) Decorating... Whip together the ingredients marked and spread on the cake. Thinly slice the strawberries and stick onto the cake. I didnt have much time, so I left out the glacage but it is much shinier and beautiful if you use it. I decorated with pieces of mint and marshmallow snowmen that my daughter made!","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Classic Italian Lasagna. Ingredients: 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus, 2 tablespoons butter, for the lasagna, 12 cup all-purpose flour, 4 cups whole milk, at room temperature, 1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, 1 12 cups tomato sauce, recipe follows, salt, white pepper, 14 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1 lb ground chuck, salt and pepper, 1 12 lbs ricotta cheese, 3 large eggs, 1 lb lasagna sheet, cooked al dente, 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry, 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, 14 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, 12 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1 small onion, chopped, 2 cloves garlic, chopped, 1 stalk celery, chopped, 1 carrot, chopped, sea salt, fresh ground black pepper, 2 (32 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes, 2 dried bay leaves, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (optional), Instructions: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bechamel sauce: In a 2-quart pot, melt 5 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. When butter has completely melted, add the flour and whisk until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent any lumps from forming. Continue to simmer and whisk over medium heat until the sauce is thick, smooth and creamy, about 10 minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon. Remove from heat and add the nutmeg and tomato sauce. Stir until well combined and check for seasoning. Set aside and allow to cool completely. In a saute pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil. When almost smoking, add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper. Brown meat, breaking any large lumps, until it is no longer pink. Remove from heat and drain any excess fat. Set aside and allow to cool completely. In a medium sized bowl, thoroughly mix the ricotta and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Into the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch baking dish, spread 1/3 of the bechamel sauce. Arrange the pasta sheets side by side, covering the bottom of the baking dish. Evenly spread a layer of all the ricotta mixture and then a layer of all the spinach. Arrange another layer of pasta sheets and spread all the ground beef on top. Sprinkle 1/2 the mozzarella cheese on top of the beef. Spread another 1/3 of the bechamel sauce. Arrange the final layer of pasta sheets and top with remaining bechamel, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into 1/4-inch cubes and top lasagna. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place lasagna dish on top, cover and put on the middle rack of the oven and bake until top is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Remove cover and continue to bake for about 15 minutes. Simple Tomato Sauce: In a large casserole pot or Dutch over, heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic and saute until soft and translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add celery and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Saute until all the vegetables are soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes and bay leaves and simmer uncovered on low heat for 1 hour or until thick. Remove bay leaves and check for seasoning. If sauce still tastes acidic, add unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time to round out the flavors. Add 1/2 the tomato sauce into the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Continue with remaining tomato sauce. If not using all the sauce, allow it to cool completely and pour 1 to 2 cup portions into freezer plastic bags. This will freeze up to 6 months.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Corned Beef Hash and Poached Eggs with Easy Hollandaise. Ingredients: 2 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, Pinch cayenne pepper, 2 tablespoons water, 1 cup (1/2 pound) unsalted butter, melted, 1/2 lemon, juiced, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 onion, chopped, 2 cups chopped corned beef, 2 cups chopped Herbed Root Vegetables, recipe follows, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 4 eggs, 2 tablespoons white vinegar, Instructions: Make the hollandaise: Put the egg yolks, mustard, cayenne, and water into a blender. Blend this together and then slowly start pouring in the warm butter with the blender running. Stop the machine when all the butter has been incorporated. Taste and adjust the seasoning with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Thin the hollandaise with a little water if it is too thick. Keep warm while you fry the hash and poach the eggs. Fry the hash: Heat the oil and butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, add the onion, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the corned beef, vegetables,and chives; cook until the bottom is brown and crisp, about 5 to 10 minutes. Poach the eggs: Meanwhile, fill a large skillet with water, bring it to a boil, and add the vinegar and a large pinch of salt. Reduce the heat until the water is just barely bubbling. Crack each egg into a small bowl and carefully slide the egg into the water. Cook until the eggs are set, about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. Remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and dab the bottom with paper towels to dry them off. Serve: Place 1/4 of the hash onto a warm plate or shallow bowl. Top with a poached egg and a couple of tablespoons of hollandaise; garnish with chives. 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 pound new potatoes, scrubbed 1 pound baby carrots, trimmed and scrubbed 1 pound baby turnips, trimmed and scrubbed 1 pound baby parsnips, trimmed and scrubbed Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Herb Butter: 1/2 pound unsalted butter, softened 1/2 cup mixed chopped fresh herbs like thyme, mint, chives, parsley, or chervil Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Put the olive oil and butter into a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the vegetables and toss to coat them well with the fat; season with salt and pepper. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the Herb Butter by combining the soft butter and herbs together; season with some salt and pepper. To serve, spread some Herb Butter in the bottom of a bowl. Add the hot vegetables and dot with more Herb Butter. Moisten with some of the cooking liquid and serve. Yield: 6 to 8 servings Prep Time: 20 minutes Cook Time: 30 minutes Ease of preparation: easy","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Steak Salad With Vegetables. Ingredients: 1 medium morel, cleaned and chopped (about 1/4 cup), 1 cup imported peanut oil, 1/4 cup good quality red-wine vinegar (or less, depending on the acidity), 1 teaspoon Dijon-type mustard, Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste, 2 heads bibb lettuce, trimmed, washed and thoroughly dried, 1 small head red Boston lettuce, trimmed, washed and thoroughly dried, 1 cup hulled green peas (about 3/4 pound), 1/2 lemon, juiced, 1 cup shelled fava beans (about 1 pound), 1 bunch scallions, cut 2 inches long, including some of the green, and trimmed, 16 tiny new potatoes, washed, 1 cup chicken stock, 5 to 7 ounces fresh small morels, cleaned just before cooking, 3 ripe tomatoes (about 1 pound), blanched, peeled, seeded and juice removed and reserved, 1 cumin seed, peeled and crushed fine, 1 tablespoon first-pressing olive oil, Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, 1 2- to 2 1/2-pound boneless sirloin with fat at room temperature, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 cup chervil sprigs, stems removed and very loosely packed (i.e. fluffy), Instructions: For the vinaigrette, clean and chop one morel. In a small pan, combine the oil with the chopped morel and warm over low heat until the oil reaches 125 to 135 degrees, or is warm to the touch. Allow to steep for two hours. Reserve. Remove the morel pieces from the oil after they have steeped. Discard the pieces. In another bowl, combine the vinegar, mustard and the seasonings and mix thoroughly. Gradually whisk in three-quarters of a cup of the morel oil or a bit more, depending on the acidity of the vinegar. Reserve. For the salad, tear the lettuce into bite-size pieces, wrap in a towel and refrigerate. In a small pot of lightly salted boiling water, add the peas and a little lemon juice and cook the peas for six to 10 minutes, until tender. Drain under cold running water and drain again. Reserve. Repeat the same process with the fava beans, adding the remaining lemon juice. Reserve. Repeat the process with the scallions, simmering them for one to two minutes. Drain thoroughly and reserve on paper towel. Repeat the process with the potatoes and cook for about 12 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and reserve in a covered pot. If the potatoes are larger than the size of a quarter, cut them in halves or quarters. In a small saucepan, heat the stock over medium heat, add the cleaned and trimmed morels and simmer for five to seven minutes, or until tender. Drain and reserve, saving the stock for some other use. To prepare the relish, chop the tomatoes very fine or pulse once or twice in a food processor. Add the cumin, oil and seasonings. If too thick, add a little of the reserved juice of the tomato and chill. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a large skillet, heat about one tablespoon of the remaining oil. Season the steak with kosher salt and pepper and raise the heat under the skillet. Sear the steak for about five minutes on each side, until lightly crusted and browned. Transfer the steak to the oven and bake for eight to 12 minutes, or until it is done to your preference. Let it rest while you cut the greens. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with enough vinaigrette to coat, then divide among four plates. Repeat the process with the vegetables and morels. Trim the fat from the steak and slice the meat into thin strips. Arrange the slices over the greens and vegetables in lattice fashion and sprinkle with chervil. Add a little of the tomato relish on the side of each plate and serve.","CREATE (:Ingredient {name: ""morel"", measure: ""1 medium, cleaned and chopped (about 1/4 cup)""})

"Recipe Name: Thick & Rich Kabocha Squash Baked Pudding. Ingredients: 300 grams Kabocha squash (peeled, steamed), 30 grams Light brown sugar (other sugars are also OK), 3 tbsp Maple syrup (other syrups are also OK), 3 Eggs, 200 ml Heavy cream, 100 ml Milk, 2 to 3 drops Vanilla oil or extract, 100 grams Granulated sugar (white sugar also OK), 2 tbsp Water, 3 tbsp Boiling water, Instructions: Remove the squashs skin, and steam in the microwave or a pot until soft. Mash it. Add to the squash and mix together, in this order the following ingredients - light brown sugar and maple, eggs, heavy cream, and milk. Itll blend together quickly. Pour through a strainer. A fine strainer is the best. Around this time preheat your oven to 170C. For the second half of straining, if you stir with a whisk itll help things along. Throw away any squash strings left over in the strainer. You can use a blender or a food processor to mix things, but you can also mix just as well with a whisk. So I dont use them. Once youve finished straining add a few drops of the vanilla oil. Use the whisk or a spatula to lightly mix it in. Pour into containers of your choosing. Tap the bottom on your table to get rid of any bubbles (but not hard enough to spill any). Arrange on your baking pan. Once the preheating has finished put in your oven and add about 1 cm of hot water to the pan. Steam bake at 170C for 30 to 40 minutes. While its baking make the caramel sauce. Add the granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of water to a thick pot and heat on medium heat. Itll start browning naturally from the outsides. Use the handles to twirl the liquid around in the pan. If you mix with the spatula from the beginning itll crystallize. Once its got a nice color stop the heat, hold a lid in one hand, use your other hand to quickly pour in the hot water, and then close the lid (thisll prevent it jumping out at you). This time I made the caramel as a topping, so I made it to be a bit runnier. Once the pudding has baked (if you can stick a toothpick in it and it comes out cleanly) top with the caramel sauce and its complete. Once its cooled down chill in the refrigerator. This time I used the squash seeds as a topping, but you dont have to. A thick and rich baked pudding. The pudding itself has a reserved sweetness, so its a great match with the sweet caramel sauce. If youre not topping with the caramel sauce then maybe you can add 10 to 20 g of sugar to the pudding mixture, whatever you like.","

"Recipe Name: Cherry and Chocolate No-Bake Cheesecake. Ingredients: 1 cm thick slice of a 15 cm diameter cake Your favorite chocolate sponge cake, 1 youll use most of it Cherry compote, 1 Cherry compote syrup, 150 ml Heavy cream, 185 grams Cream cheese, 30 grams Sugar (fine granulated sugar), 55 grams Sweet chocolate (I used 56% cocoa), 1 tbsp Kirsch, 5 grams Gelatin powder, 25 ml Water, 35 grams Chocolate for garnishing, 80 grams Heavy cream, 30 grams Sweet chocolate, 1 Mint leaves, 1 Nappage (if you have it), Instructions: Line the bottom of the cake pan with the sponge cake, then brush a good amount of the cherry compote syrup over the top. Soak the powdered gelatin in water. Melt the cheese creams chocolate in a double boiler. Make the cheese cream. Whip the heavy cream until it is thick and forms soft peaks. Put into the refrigerator. Soften the cream cheese in the microwave for a bit, then thoroughly combine with the sugar in a bowl using a whisk. If its a bit hard to mix, use a rubber spatula to knead it, then switch back to the whisk. Once smooth, add the melted chocolate and mix well. Next, add the Kirsch and mix well. Dissolve the gelatin in a double boiler, then add it to the bowl. Quickly mix it in. Mix in the chilled heavy cream from Step 3 one half at a time until it is smooth and thick. Pour a bit of the batter on top of the sponge cake and smooth with a rubber spatula. Lightly press a layer of the cherry compote over the top. Pour the remaining cheese cream over the compote and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Tap the sides and the bottom of the pan to break the air bubbles for a clean surface. Place in the refrigerator as-is and let chill for at least 2 hours to set. While you wait, melt the decoration chocolate in a double boiler. Use a dough scraper to spread a thin layer of the tempered chocolate over kitchen parchment paper. Place in the refrigerator to harden, then use a knife or your hands to break it up into pieces. Return to the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Put the heavy cream for the decoration in a pot and heat over low heat. Once warm, turn off the heat and add the sweet chocolate. Stir while melting. Dont let it boil. Transfer to a bowl, then place the bowl in ice water to cool while mixing. Once cooled, put into the refrigerator until ready to use. While mixing, be careful not to make bubbles. Once Step 9s cake has firmed up well, remove from the pan. Whisk Step 13s cream until it forms firm peaks. Use a palette knife to spread a thin layer of the cream along the sides of the cake. Attach the chocolate pieces from Step 11. Put the remaining chocolate cream into a pastry bag with a round tip and squeeze onto the top of the cake as desired. Pat the cherry compote dry and coat in nappage. Arrange on the top of the cake with the mint leaves to finish. Theres a lot of cherries, so be careful when cutting. Its rather hard to cut. The plump cherries are extravagant.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Grilled Langoustines With Vegetable Vinaigrette. Ingredients: 12 langoustines or jumbo shrimp, about 1 pound, Salt to taste, if desired, Freshly ground pepper to taste, 12 tablespoons olive oil, approximately, 13 pound haricots verts (thin French green beans), 4 large mushrooms, about 1/4 pounds, 3 large red ripe tomatoes, about 1 1/4 pounds, peeled, 2 small artichokes, about 2/3 pound, 1/2 lemon, 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1 tablespoon liquid from canned black truffles, Sprigs of chervil or parsley for garnish, Instructions: Shell and devein the langoustines or shrimp, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rub all over with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Set aside. If the langoustines or shrimp are to be grilled, preheat a gas- or wood-burning grill until it is quite hot. Bring enough water to a boil to cover the haricots verts when they are added. Add the beans, and let simmer 5 minutes. Drain and drop the beans immediately into a basin of ice water. Drain thoroughly and chill. Cut each bean into 2-inch lengths. Set aside. Cut the mushroom caps crosswise in half. Scrape away and discard the black gills inside. Cut the mushroom caps and stems into the thinnest possible slices. There should be about 3/4 cup. Set aside. Remove and discard the tomato seeds. Cut the flesh into 1/4-inch cubes. There should be about 1 1/4 cups. Pull away and discard the tough outer leaves of each artichoke. Cut away and discard the bottom stems of each. Using a sharp paring knife, trim all around the sides and base of each artichoke until each is smooth and white, with the green exterior pared away. As you work, rub the cut portions with half a lemon to prevent discoloration. Using a melon-ball scoop or spoon, trim away and discard the center fuzzy portion of each artichoke. Cut the artichokes into quarters, and slice each piece as thinly as possible. There should be about 2/3 cup. Put the haricots verts, mushrooms, tomatoes and artichokes into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Combine 8 tablespoons of the olive oil, the lemon and truffle juices and salt and pepper to taste in a mixing bowl. Beat with a wire whisk to blend. Pour this over the vegetables, and toss to blend. Spoon the vegetable mixture into the center of an oval or circular plate. If the langoustines or shrimp are to be grilled, place them on the grill, and cook about 2 minutes. Turn and cook about 3 minutes or until done. Cooking time will depend on the size of the shellfish. Do not overcook. If the langoustines or shrimp are to be cooked in a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and cook, shaking the skillet and stirring, about 5 minutes or until the shellfish are cooked through. Arrange the hot langoustines or shrimp around the vegetables, and spoon 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the shellfish. Garnish the dish with sprigs of chervil or parsley.","```cypher

Prepare piecrust mixes as labels direct, but make up all packages at once. Divide pastry into 5 equal pieces. On floured pastry cloth, with stockinette-covered rolling pin, roll one piece into a 14"" x 11"" rectangle; cut into 2 rectangles about 6 1/2"" x 10""; reserve scraps. Place 1/3 cup mushroom mixture about 2"" from 6 1/2"" end of rectangle. Top with piece of meat. Sprinkle meat lightly with salt. Top with one whole mushroom. Brush egg white mixture along edges of pastry. Fold pastry over meat and mushroom, overlapping edges. Press lightly to seal edges. Place pastry-wrapped meat on a large cookie sheet. Keep refrigerated while preparing remaining meat pieces. Roll out remaining scraps of pastry. With sharp knife or small canape cutter, cut pastry into designs. Brush back of designs with egg-white mixture. Arrange on top of pastry. Refrigerate until baking time. About 35 minutes before serving, preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a cup, beat egg yolks with 2 teaspoon water. Brush over pastry. Bake 25 minutes for rare, 27 minutes for medium doneness. With pancake turner, place Wellingtons on a warm platter.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Ukrainian Lokshyna (Egg Noodles). Ingredients: 1 egg, 1 tablespoon water, 1 cup flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, Instructions: Beat the egg slightly and combine with the remaining ingredients to make a stiff dough. Knead on a lightly floured board until the dough is smooth. Cover and let it stand for 30 minutes. Roll to almost paper-thinness and allow it to dry partially. Turn the dough over in order to dry the other side slightly. It must neither be sticky nor dry and brittle. Fold into a roll or cut into 3 inch strips. Stack the strips on top of each other. Cut the roll or the strips crosswise into fine shreds. Separate the shreds by tossing them lightly with the fingers. Spread them out to dry. The noodles may be used at once or dried thoroughly, and then stored in a covered container for future use. When ready to use, drop the noodles into a large quantity of boiling salted water, stir, and cook for about 8 minutes. The cooking period will depend on the size of the noodles. Strain over a colander or sieve, and then rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Use as desired. BROAD OR SQUARE LOKSHNA: Follow the preceding recipe for Lokshyna. Cut the dough into broad shreds or tiny squares. These may be used in various lokshyna dishes. LOKSHYNA WITH COTTAGE CHEESE: Here is a nutritious dish which is very simple to make. Prepare a desired amount of lokshyna. Cook as directed. Drain, but do not rinse the lokshyna with cold water. Add some melted butter or bacon fat and mix lightly. Mix in some fresh cottage cheese and season to taste with salt. Top with chopped crisp bacon or salt pork. Keep it hot until ready to serve. LOKSHYNA WITH EGGS: Follow the preceding recipe, but instead of the cheese use lightly beaten eggs. To 1 cup of cooked lokshyna allow about 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 egg. Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the cooked lokshyna mixed with the eggs and seasoned with salt. Cook and stir as for scrambled eggs. Serve immediately.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Demayo Chocolate Cake. Ingredients: 2 cups sugar, 1 cup cake flour, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process), 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 14 teaspoon salt, 1 cup low-fat buttermilk, 3 large eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 12 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm, 2 -3 tablespoons heavy cream (if needed), 34 cup unsalted butter, 2 cups half-and-half, 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 6 large egg yolks, 2 12 cups shredded unsweetened coconut (preferably unsulphured), 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut, 1 cup chopped pecans (for a little extra crunch), Instructions: MAKE CUSTARD FILLING FIRST:. Combine first 4 ingredients in a medium saucepan; bring to a full boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, and simmer about 1 minute. Whisk together egg yolks in a large bowl until well combined. Whisk about 1 cup hot cream mixture into yolks to temper them, then pour yolk mixture back into saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking often, until slightly thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and whisk in coconut, stirring until thoroughly combined. (As you stir, coconut will absorb custard, and filling will thicken.) Pour filling onto an 18- x 13-inch rimmed baking sheet, and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover with aluminum foil, and chill at least 2 hours, or until cool. MAKE CAKE:. Preheat oven to 350F Butter three 8- x 2-inch round cake pans. Line pans with parchment paper; butter paper. Sift first 6 ingredients into a 10-quart bowl (or the largest you have). Stir until well combined. Whisk together buttermilk, eggs, vanilla, and 1 cup room-temperature water in a medium bowl until just combined. Immediately add to flour mixture, and whisk until smooth, scraping down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add butter, and whisk until well combined. Batter will be thin. Divide batter evenly among prepared pans, gently shaking pans to level batter if necessary. Bake 16 to 19 minutes or until cakes are springy to the touch, start to pull away from sides of pans, and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. ASSEMBLY:. Let cakes cool in pans on cooling racks for 10 minutes, then invert onto racks, remove pans and parchment, and invert again so cakes are right side up. Place 1 cake layer on an 8-inch cardboard round or cake plate. Using a stiff offset metal spatula (the blade bends up where it meets the handle), spread one-third of chilled Custard Filling evenly over the top of the layer. (If filling seems too stiff, gradually stir in heavy cream to loosen it a bit.) Top with second cake layer, and spread another one-third of filling over the top. Place final cake layer on top, and spread with remaining filling, leaving sides bare. Sprinkle coconut over cake. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 2 to 3 days. Slice into hearty wedges, and serve a little cooler than room temperature. *After baking, cake layers can be assembled as described above or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and chilled up to 1 day or frozen up to 1 month.","```cypher
