"Recipe Name: White Chocolate and Lemon Wedding Cake. Ingredients: 6 cups sugar, 9 teaspoons cornstarch, 3 cups fresh lemon juice, 36 large egg yolks, 3 cups (6 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, 16 ounces imported white chocolate (such as Lindt or Perugina), finely chopped (do not use chips), 6 8-ounce packages Philadelphia-brand cream cheese, room temperature, 5 cups (packed) powdered sugar (about 1 1/4 pounds), 4 cups chilled heavy whipping cream, 4 cups lemon curd (see above), 14 ounces imported white chocolate (such as Lindt or Perugina), finely chopped (do not use chips), 1 1/3 cups chilled heavy whipping cream, 11 cups sifted cake flour, 11 teaspoons baking powder, 2 1/2 teaspoons salt, 3 cups buttermilk, 6 tablespoons thawed frozen orange juice concentrate, 5 tablespoons vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, 6 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil, 2 1/2 cups egg whites (about 20 large), 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar, 2 11-inch-diameter tart-pan bottoms or cardboard rounds, 1 8-inch-diameter tart-pan bottom or cardboard round (cut from 9-inch round), 1 5-inch-diameter tart-pan bottom or cardboard round (cut from 6-inch round), 14 12-inch-long, 1/4-inch-diameter wooden dowels, Mix of large and tiny white roses and fresias (about 5 dozen), 8 1-pint containers fresh strawberries, hulled, halved, 2 1/2-pint containers fresh blackberries, 2 1/2-pint containers fresh raspberries, 2 1/2-pint containers fresh blueberries, 1 cup sugar, Instructions: Make the curd in two separate batches. Its used as a filling between the cake layers and as a component in the mousse. Whisk 3 cups sugar and 4 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch in heavy medium saucepan to blend. Gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups lemon juice, then 18 yolks. Add 1 1/2 cups butter. Cook over medium heat until curd thickens and boils, whisking constantly, about 18 minutes. Transfer curd to medium bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface of curd. Make second batch of curd, using same amount of each ingredient. Refrigerate at least 1 day. (Can be made 7 days ahead. Keep chilled.) Make the frosting in two separate batches at least one day ahead. One batch is for the 12-inch cake, one for the other two cakes. Cream replaces butter in this variation of the standard cream cheese frosting, so its spreadable straight from the fridge. Use heavy whipping cream for the best results. Place 8 ounces chocolate in top of double boiler set over barely simmering water. Stir just until chocolate is melted, smooth, and just warm (do not overheat); remove from over water. Using electric mixer, beat 3 packages cream cheese in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in 1 1/4 cups sugar, then warm chocolate. Beat 2 cups cream and 1 1/4 cups sugar in medium bowl until medium-firm peaks form. Fold into cream cheese mixture in 3 additions. Cover; chill. Make second batch of frosting, using same amount of each ingredient. Refrigerate frosting at least 1 day and up to 4 days. Place lemon curd in large bowl and refrigerate. Place white chocolate in top of double boiler set over barely simmering water. Stir just until chocolate is melted, smooth, and just warm (do not overheat); remove from over water. Beat whipping cream in another large bowl until medium-firm peaks form; fold in warm white chocolate. Fold mixture into lemon curd in 3 additions. Cover bowl and chill mousse until cold and set, at least 1 day and up to 4 days. Use half of these ingredients to make the 12-inch cake and half to make both the 9- inch and the 6-inch cakes. Sift the flour first, then measure it. Position rack just below center of oven and preheat to 350F. Butter and flour 12-inch-diameter cake pan with removable bottom and 3-inch-high sides. Butter and flour 9-inch-diameter cake pan with removable bottom and 3-inch-high sides. Butter and flour 6-inch-diameter cake pan with removable bottom and 3-inch-high sides. Sift 5 1/2 cups sifted cake flour, 5 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 3 times into large bowl. Mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 3 tablespoons orange juice concentrate, and 2 1/2 tablespoons vanilla in small bowl. Using electric mixer, beat 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter in large bowl until smooth and fluffy. Gradually beat in 1 1/4 cups sugar, then 3/4 cup oil. Beat in 1 more cup sugar. Beat in flour mixture in 4 additions alternately with buttermilk mixture in 3 additions, scraping down sides of bowl often. Using clean dry beaters, beat 1 1/4 cups (about 10) egg whites and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar in another large bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1 cup sugar, beating until whites fall from beaters in thick, puffy (not stiff) ribbon, about 4 minutes. Fold whites into batter in 4 additions. Transfer batter to prepared 12-inch pan. Bake cake until brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 25 minutes. Cool cake in pan on rack 30 minutes. Cut around cake to loosen; remove pan sides. Maintain oven temperature. Make second batch of cake batter following same technique as for first cake and using same amount of each ingredient. Transfer 8 1/2 cups batter to prepared 9-inch pan; transfer 4 cups batter to prepared 6-inch pan. Bake cakes until brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes for 6-inch cake and 1 hour 18 minutes for 9-inch cake. Cool cakes in pans on racks 30 minutes. Cut around cakes to loosen. Remove pan sides. Cool all cakes completely. (Can be made 1 day before filling and frosting the cakes. Return cakes to pans. Cover with foil and store at room temperature.) To make filling and frosting the cakes easier, use tart-pan bottoms or buy cardboard rounds from a cake and candy supply store. Push 12-inch cake up to release from pan. Using large serrated knife, cut off enough of top crust to make cake 2 1/2 inches high. Cut cake horizontally into 3 layers, each about 3/4 inch thick. Using tart-pan bottom or 11-inch cardboard round, transfer top layer to work surface and cover; transfer middle layer to work surface and cover. Cut bottom layer from pan bottom and place on tart-pan bottom or cardboard round. Spread generous 1 3/4 cups mousse over. Drop 1 3/4 cups curd over by tablespoonfuls and spread to cover mousse in even layer. Refrigerate until mousse and curd are firm, about 1 hour. Using tart-pan bottom, place middle layer on bottom layer. Spread with same amounts of mousse and curd. Using tart-pan bottom, place top layer on cake and press lightly. Refrigerate assembled cake. Push 9-inch cake up to release from pan. Cut off enough of top crust to make cake 2 1/2 inches high. Cut cake horizontally into 3 layers, each about 3/4 inch thick. Using tart-pan bottom or cardboard round, transfer top layer to work surface and cover; repeat with middle layer. Cut bottom layer from pan bottom and place on 8-inch tart-pan bottom or cardboard round. Spread 1 1/4 cups mousse over. Drop generous 2/3 cup curd over by tablespoonfuls and spread to cover mousse in even layer. Refrigerate until mousse and curd are firm, about 1 hour. Using tart-pan bottom, place middle layer on bottom layer. Spread with same amount of mousse and curd. Using tart-pan bottom, place top layer on cake and press lightly. Refrigerate assembled cake. Push 6-inch cake up to release from pan. Cut off enough of top crust to make cake 2 1/2 inches high. Cut cake horizontally into 3 layers, each about 3/4 inch thick. Transfer top layer to work surface and cover; repeat with middle layer. Cut bottom layer from pan bottom and place on 5-inch tart-pan bottom or cardboard round. Spread generous 1/2 cup mousse over. Drop 6 tablespoons curd over by tablespoonfuls and spread to cover mousse in even layer. Refrigerate until mousse and curd are firm, about 1 hour. Using large spatula, place middle layer on bottom layer. Spread with same amount of mousse and curd. Using large spatula, place top layer on cake and press lightly. Refrigerate assembled cake. Spread 2 1/4 cups frosting thinly over top and sides of 12-inch assembled cake as first coat. Spread 1 1/2 cups frosting thinly over top and sides of 9-inch assembled cake. Spread 3/4 cup frosting thinly over top and sides of 6-inch assembled cake. Chill all cakes 1 hour. Spread 5 cups frosting over 12-inch cake. Spread 3 2/3 cups frosting over 9-inch cake. Spread 2 cups frosting over 6-inch cake. Refrigerate 6-inch cake. Place 12-inch cake on platter. Press 1 dowel straight down into center and through to bottom of cake. Mark dowel 1 1/4 inches above level of frosting. Remove dowel and cut with serrated knife at marked point. Cut 7 more dowels to same length. Press 1 dowel back into center of cake. Press remaining 7 dowels into cake, spaced equally apart and 3 to 3 1/4 inches from center dowel. Chill cake with dowels. Press 1 dowel straight down into center of 9-inch cake. Mark dowel 1 1/4 inches above level of frosting. Remove dowel and cut with serrated knife at marked point. Cut 5 more dowels to same length. Press 1 dowel back into center of cake. Press remaining dowels into cake, spaced equally apart and 2 inches from center; chill with dowels. (Can be made 2 days ahead. After frosting is firm, cover cakes with cake domes or loosely with foil; keep chilled.) Mix of large and tiny white roses and freesias (about 5 dozen) Place 9-inch cake atop dowels in 12-inch cake. Place 6-inch cake atop dowels in 9-inch cake. Place large roses between bottom and middle tiers, fitting in tiny roses and freesias to fill space. Fill space between middle and top tiers with mix of flowers. This fruit compote contributes color and flavor contrast to each serving of the cake. Combine all ingredients in large bowl; toss to coat. Cover; chill until juices form, at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours. Place top and middle cake tiers on work surface. Remove flowers and dowels from cakes. Cut top cake into 8 slices. Cut middle cake into 16 slices. Insert knife straight down into 12-inch cake 3 inches from edge. Continue to cut around cake 3 inches from edge, making 6-inch-diameter circle in center. Cut outer ring into 18 slices. Cut 6-inch center into 8 slices. Place cake slices on plates; spoon compote alongside each.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Basic Dough for White Bread, French Breads, Pizzas, and Hard Rolls. Ingredients: 1 package (a scant Tbs) active dry yeast, 1/3 cup tepid water (not over 110F), Pinch of sugar, 1 cup cold water, plus more if needed, 3 1/2 cups (1 pound) unbleached white all-purpose, or bread flour, plus a little more if needed, 1 Tbs rye or whole-wheat flour, 2 1/4 tsp salt, Instructions: Proof yeast in tepid water with the sugar for 5 minutes (see below), then stir in the cold water. Measure the flours and salt into the food processor fitted with a steel blade. With the machine running, rather slowly process in the yeast and water, adding driblets more cold water if needed, until the dough balls up on top of the blade. Let it revolve 8 to 10 times, then stop the machine and feel the dough. It should be reasonably soft and pliable. If damp and wet, process in a tablespoon or so more flour; if dry, add a dribble more cold water. Let rest for 5 minutes. Process the dough another 15 seconds or so, then remove it to a floured board and let it rest 2 minutes. Knead it vigorously by hand a good 50 times, as described below. Preliminary Rise. Turn the dough into a 4-quart fairly straight-sided ungreased bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a towel, and set in a draft-free place75F is ideal. Dough will rise to 1 1/2 times its original volume, usually in about 1 hour. Second Rise. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board. Push and pat it into a 14-inch rectangle and fold it into 3, like a business letter. Repeat a second time, then return it to the ungreased bowl, cover, and let rise again. It will rise to 2 1/2 to 3 times its original volume, usually in 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When almost tripled, the dough is ready to form and bake. The very special movements here are designed to force the dough to develop a gluten cloak that holds as it bakes free-form into its characteristic loaf. Keep your work surface lightly floured at all times, so the gradually forming cloak will not tear. Set a smooth, lightly floured cotton or linen towel on a large rimless (or upside-down) baking sheet, to hold the formed loaves. Cut the dough in half, then fold each piece in half. Cover one; push and pat the other into an 8-by-10-inch roughly rectangular shape. Fold in half lengthwise. Press and pound firmly with your fist to seal the edges and flatten the dough to about its original shape. Roll the dough so the seam is centered on top, and firmly press a rough trench into the seam with the side of your hand. Using the seam as a guide, fold the dough in half lengthwise, and again press long edges together firmly to seal. Starting at its center, begin rolling this length of dough under your open palms, gradually moving your hands apart and stretching the dough as you roll. Elongate the dough to about 18 inches (no longer than the length of your baking surface!) and place it seam side up on the long half of the lightly floured towel. I now like to pinch the sealed long edges securely together, just to be sure. Cover loosely with another floured towel while you form the second loaf the same way. Make a pleat in the towel alongside the first loaf, to separate the two loaves, and lay the second in place. Final Rise Before Baking. Usually 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Cover both loaves with the floured towel and let rise until more than doubled in volume. Meanwhile, make everything ready for baking, so that you may proceed almost at once. To Bake 2 Loaves of French Bread. Slide the oven rack onto the middle or lower-middle level, set the baking stone or tiles upon it, and preheat the oven to 450F. Sprinkle the sliding board lightly with cornmeal, and have your unmolding board and instant-read thermometer at hand. Remove the covering towel and place the unmolding board against the inside side of one loaf, lift the towel on the other side, and flip the loaf, its smooth side up, onto the board, then nudge the loaf onto one side of the sliding board. Repeat with the second loaf. Push the loaves so that the ends of each are at one end of the board. With a razor blade held almost flat, make 3 slightly angled slashes in the top of each loaf. Open the oven door. Poise the sliding board so that the ends of the loaves are about 1 inch from the back of the oven, then quickly snatch the board out from under the loaves, depositing them on the hot surface. Immediately pour 1/2 cup water onto oven floor or hot pan (see page 83). Close the door. Bake 20 minutes; reduce temperature to 400F and bake 10 minutes more, until done (see below). Remove and cool on a rack. BAGUETTES. After the second rise, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Shape, roll, and stretch each into a thin (2-inch diameter) rope; let rise until more than doubled. Bake as for fat loaves, but check for doneness 5 minutes after reducing heat to 400F. ROUND COUNTRY LOAF (OR LOAVES). After the second rise, turn the dough out onto a floured surface; deflate as described in the master recipe. Use all the dough for 1 large loaf, or divide in half for 2 smaller loaves. Pat the dough into a disk. Lift one side and bring it almost over the other; rotate a quarter turn, and repeat 6 to 8 times, to make a thick cushion. Turn the dough over and rotate it between your palms, tucking the sides under as you go, to make a smooth, round loaf. Turn the dough over, smooth side underneath. Pinch the edges together, set on a floured towel, and cover with another towel. (Repeat with the remaining dough, if you are making 2.) Let rise until more than doubled. Prepare and preheat oven to 450F as in the master recipe. Transfer the loaves smooth side up to the cornmeal-dusted sliding board. Slash the top with your razor in a decorative pattern, such as a crosshatch or a tree with branches. Slide into the oven, create steam, and bake as in the master recipe. Large loaves may need an additional 10 to 15 minutes at 375F to finish baking. BAKING IN LOAF PAN. Butter a 2-quart loaf pan. Pat the dough into a rectangle slightly smaller than the pan. Fold in half lengthwise twice, as for long loaves, to form an even rectangle. Place seam down in pan, press flat into corners. Let rise until dough has doubled in volume. Meanwhile, slide rack onto lower-third level, and preheat the oven to 450F. Slash top of loaf lengthwise down the center with a razor, and bake for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 400F. When done, turn out of pan and cool on a rack. HARD FRENCH ROLLS. After its second rise, divide dough into 12 pieces. Fold each in half. One at a time (or 2 when you are an expert), rotate the dough under the palm of one hand to form a ball. Pinch undersides to seal, and set smooth side down on a lightly floured towel. Cover with a second towel and let rise until more than doubled. Prepare and preheat the oven to 450F, as in the master recipe. Arrange the rolls 3 or 4 at a time smooth side up at the end of your cornmeal-dusted sliding board. Slash each with a circular stroke around the side, or a cross on top. Slide onto baking stone and rapidly continue with the rest. Make steam as in the master recipe. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375F and bake a few minutes more until done. PIZZA. For two 16-inch tomato pizzas. Set rack on the lower-middle level and preheat the oven and pizza stone to 450F. Form the dough into 2 smooth balls and let rest, covered. After 10 minutes, lightly flour a pizza paddle; flatten and stretch the dough into a thin disk on the paddle by rolling it out and pressing into shape with your fingers, or stretch and twirl it, professional-style, while supporting it on both your fists and twisting them apartyoull have to see it done to do it! Brush the top of the dough generously with olive oil, dust with 1/2 cup of grated hard cheese, and spread over 2 cups of fresh tomato sauce (page 30). Drizzle on more olive oil, sprinkle on 1/2 cup or so of grated mozzarella cheese; a sprinkle of thyme, oregano, or Italian herbs; and a little salt and pepper. Drizzle on more oil and another 1/2-cup dusting of grated hard cheese. Slide onto hot baking stone and bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until top is bubbling, edges have puffed, and bottom is crisped. Prepare second pizza while first is baking. Its always wise to make sure your yeast is really active. Stir a tablespoon of active dry yeast in a cup with 3 tablespoons of tepid water and a pinch of sugar. In 5 minutes it should begin to bubble. Its alive! If you overknead in the processor, the dough can heat up; in addition, the gluten strands can break down, preventing a full rise. To finish the dough, fold it over on itself, then, with the heels of your hands, push it out in front of you, roughly, rapidly, and vigorously. Repeat about 50 times, until it is smooth and elastic and when you stretch the dough it holds together. It should not stick to your hands unless you pinch and hold a piece. Flour contains both starch and gluten. The gluten holds the particles together and also allows the dough to hold its rise. However, gluten develops increasing resistance as the dough is worked, and it then becomes more and more difficult to manipulate. Whenever your dough wont roll easily, simply stop where you are and let it rest 10 minutes or so. The gluten will relax, and you can continue. Ideal temperatures are 70 to 75F. Warmer, the rise is too fast and you miss out on flavor development. Colder is fine, even down to a refrigerator chillyou get flavor developmentbut it simply takes the dough longer to rise: the colder the environment, the longer it takes. French bread not only rises free-form, but it bakes free-formnot in a pan. It is difficult, even frustrating to attempt it without the proper equipment. Here is what you will need. A Hot Baking Surface. French bread does not cook properly when baked on a metal sheet. It must be slid upon a baking stone or a pizza stone, or line your oven rack with ceramic quarry tilesavailable in some cookware shops or in building-supply stores. Unmolding and Sliding Boards. The risen loaf is unmolded from its floured towel and slid onto the hot baking surface. I use 3/8-inch plywood bought at the home-improvement store, an 8-by-20-inch board for unmolding and for sliding a single loaf, and a 20-inch board 2 inches narrower than the width of my oven for sliding several long loaves or rolls. Cornmeal. A light dusting of coarse cornmeal on the sliding board keeps the dough from sticking. Steam. To prolong the rise and set the crust, you need steam the first few seconds of baking. In an electric oven, toss 1/2 cup water into the bottom, just before closing the door. In a gas oven, set a hot cast-iron frying pan on the lowest level as you preheat, and toss the water into that when the time comes. If you prefer to make the dough entirely by hand, mix the ingredients in a bowl with a sturdy wooden spoon, then turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. For the first few minutes, pick it up with a scraper and slap it down roughly, and continue a number of times, until the dough begins to have body. Let rest 5 minutes. Then proceed to knead it with your hands as described below. The loaves should feel light, they should make a pleasant thump when tapped, but they are not done until an instantread thermometer, left in for several seconds, reads 200F.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Moist and Fluffy Souffle Cheesecake. Ingredients: 200 grams Cream cheese, 200 ml Milk, 4 medium Egg, 70 grams Sugar (granulated), 40 grams Cake flour, 10 grams Cornstarch, 20 grams Lemon juice, 4 tbsp Apricot jam, 1 Butter (Margarine), 1 Powdered sugar (fine granulated sugar), Instructions: Measure and prepare all the ingredients. Combine and sift the cake flour and corn starch together. Squeeze the lemon and make lemon juice. Using spring form cake pan will be easier when removing the cake once it is ready. All pictures use an 18 cm cake mold. Spread butter on the sides of the cake mold, and line with parchment paper. Make sure that the paper doesnt come off while baking. (This is to prevent wrinkling while baking.) The batter will rise a lot, so let the paper exceed the edge of the mold by 2 cm. Cover the bottom of the cake mold with an aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in when using a springform pan. Spread butter evenly on the surface of the paper lined in the cake mold, and sprinkle on powdered sugar evenly. No need to spread butter on the bottom part. If there are any parts left not covered with the butter and powdered sugar, it might prevent the cake from rising properly, so be precise. Make sure to spread butter and powdered sugar on the part of the paper sticking out of the cake mold. Brush off excess sugar with a brush. Store in the refrigerator until youre done with the batter. Separate eggs into whites and yolks. The meringue will turn out nicer if the eggs are cold, so chill the eggs until its time to whip them up. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes, so keeping the eggs in the freezer will be just the right place to store the eggs until whipping. Make the cheese batter. Put milk and cream cheese in a pan. Warm up and melt the cheese but make sure that the mixture does not come to a boil (otherwise the cheese will separate). Transfer the mixture to a bowl when most of the cream cheese has melted, and mix well to dissolve all clumps. Let the mixture cool until you will be able to keep your finger in. Add one egg yolk at a time and mix. Add all egg yolks and mix well. Add 20 g of the sugar (10 g when using a 15 cm cake mold), and mix. Sift cake flour and corn starch into the mixture, and mix. Mix with a whisk to avoid the flour from clumping, and add lemon juice. Preheat oven to 340F/170C. Pour hot water, about 175F/ 180C, into the baking sheet. Whip up the meringue. Start whipping up the chilled egg white using the high setting on your hand mixer. Whisk for a while without adding sugar. When the egg white starts to form big bubbles, becomes white, and increases in volume, add 1/3 of sugar and whip it up further. When the foam of the meringue starts to become finer, add half of the remaining sugar and continue whipping. Continue whipping. Reduce the hand mixer level to low and make the foam finer. When the meringue becomes white and thicker, add the rest of sugar and continue whipping. The meringue will form peaks when you lift it up if you continue whipping. The best condition of meringue will be in between soft peak form and stiff peak form. It should not drop even when you turn the bowl of meringue up side down. Dont whip it up too much and make the meringue too tough! The egg white on the edge of the bowl will not be whipped up well when using an electric hand mixer, so take a whisk and mix the whole mixture together. The meringue will then become a little bit soft, so continue whipping using the whisk and adjust the softness. Mix the meringue into the cheese batter. Add one scoop of meringue (about 1/4 of the whole bowl of meringue) and mix well. Blend in well, not worrying about maintaining the foamy texture of the meringue. Then add the cheese batter mixed with meringue into the bowl of meringue. This is, because the meringue is stiff, so if you add the meringue to the cheese batter, the meringue tends to float on the cheese batter and will be difficult to blend in. Pour in about 1/3 of the cheese batter, and mix using a rubber spatula. Add the cheese batter to the meringue in 2 to 3 portions. Mix well after each addition. Mix well from the bottom of the bowl, so that there will not be any part left thats left unmixed. The meringue is firm, so it will maintain a foamy texture even if you mix a lot. Dont worry even the foam of the meringue shrinks a little. Mix well. If you keep the batter unmixed for a long time, the cake will have two layers, a hard part like a pudding and a souffle part when you bake it, so be careful. Pour the batter into the cake mold. It will be like a mound if you pour the batter in slowly. The batter will be jiggly. How hard the batter becomes depends on how hard the cream cheese was at the beginning. Do not worry even the batter feels a bit loose. Hold the cake mold, and shake it gently to even out the surface of the batter. Remove any air bubbles that rise to the surface. Bake for 20 minutes in a 320F/160C oven. Make sure not to burn yourself, because there is hot water in the baking sheet. Adjust the temperature depending on the oven. It will be better if the oven temperature is on the lower side. Bake in a rotating system if possible. The batter will rise slowly, and will start to brown. Reduce the oven temperature to 285F/140C and bake for another 40 minutes. Add hot water to the baking sheet at this point if the water has evaporated. The cake will rise until the edge of the paper. Cover the cake with an aluminum foil if the ceiling of the oven is low and is easier to burn. If the cake rises too much, open the door and reduce the temperature (but do not open for too long). Poke a bamboo skewer through the cake and if it comes out clean, the cake is ready. Cool the cake down for about 5 minutes while keeping the door of the oven open to release the steam. The cake will deflate in a twinkle when you take the cake out of the oven. The small hole on the lower part of the cake in the picture is the hole from poking in the skewer... Simmer a mixture of apricot jam and water, then spread it on the surface of the cake. This will give the cake a nice glossy finish. Leave the cake to cool down in the cake mold. The picture shows what it looks like 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven. The final height of the cake will be about the height of the batter before baking + 1 cm. Look at this beautiful surface without any cracks! When the cake has cool down for the most part, remove the paper on the side. The bottom part of the cake will still be soft when it is hot, so it will easily break. It will be easier to remove the paper from the bottom when the cake has completely cool down. The flavor of the eggs might be strong when the cake is still fresh out of the oven. Let the cake sit overnight if possible to let the taste set. Then the fluffy souffle cheese cakesouffle fromage will be ready. This is what happens if dont spread butter and powdered sugar on the parchment paper. I thought maybe the surface of the cake wouldnt crack, since Im improving my technique... but it cracked without the trick. The butter and powdered sugar on the parchment paper seems like a must. If baking for 50 minutes in 320F/160C. I thought that the surface might crack if the temperature is too high, but it was fine. Its just that the brown color became a bit dark, so you might need to cover the surface with an aluminum foil while baking... It seems that you dont need to be so nervous about the temperature for baking, however. *My recent lucky find. I found this disposable aluminum pan in the outdoors / camping corner of the supermarket. You can use this instead of a sheet of aluminum foil to place underneath the spring form cake pan, then you can re-use it many times. The height is a little bit high, so cut it into your desired size. * For those who only have large size eggs. Calculate one egg white to weigh 30 g (120 g in total). The egg yolk amount should be fine as is, if you use all 4. * If you are using a cake mold thats 18 cm in diameter, and you dont want it to be so high, use these ratios of ingredients. 50 ml cream cheese, 150 ml milk, 3 medium sized eggs, 55 g sugar, 30 g cake flour, 8 g corn starch and 15 g lemon juice. * Changing the 200 ml milk into 100 ml milk and 100 ml heavy cream will make the cake richer. The calories will be higher, but I recommend this one too. You can also add a little bit of vanilla extract or liquor. You can also use yogurt instead of milk if you dont have lemon. Its a pretty rough recipe. How to line the mold 1: Cut and prepare paper for the bottom and for the side. You can use normal paper, which you use for baking cakes such as glassine paper or baking paper. You can also use parchment paper. How to line the mold 2: Spread butter or margarine on the side of the cake mold evenly. It should act as an adhesive agent so that the paper will not bend. How to line the mold 3: Set the loose bottom in the mold and line with paper. Line the paper on the side and stick it to the side well. How to line the mold 4: After lining the paper, spread butter or margarine on the paper. Spread a lot, but it will also be a problem if you spread too much.... Spreading butter or margarine on the paper sticking out of the mold will be difficult (the part where the finger is pointing in the picture), but hang in there. Make sure to not leave any part ungreased. How to line the mold 5: After spreading on butter or margarine, sprinkle on powdered sugar. Be careful not to remove the lined paper from the mold. Use a brush and make sure that the sugar is spread even in the corners. Remove excess sugar, and that is it. Store in the refrigerator to keep it cool. Addendum: Heres a trick to prevent cracking. First bake in 300F/150C for 30 minutes and then open the oven door for about 5 seconds to release the steam, close the door again, turn off the oven and let the cake steam for 30 minutes. Poke a bamboo skewer through the cake and if the cake is not yet fully cooked, do not take it out of the oven. Instead, turn on the oven again and bake for 10 minutes in 320F/160C.","```cypher

Line bottoms of 6-inch-diameter, 9-inch-diameter and 12-inch-diameter cake pans with 3-inch-high sides with parchment paper. Spray parchment and sides of pans with nonstick spray. Sift flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat unsalted butter in very large bowl (at least 8-quart capacity) until smooth. Gradually add 3 cups sugar, beating until fluffy. Beat in flour mixture in 5 additions alternately with 3 1/2 cups water in 4 additions, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in another large bowl until medium-firm peaks form. Gradually add remaining 2 cups sugar, beating until whites are very thick and glossy, about 5 minutes. Fold 1/3 of whites into batter to lighten. Fold in remaining whites in 2 additions. Fold in chocolate pieces. Transfer 2 1/3 cups cake batter to prepared 6-inch pan, 4 2/3 cups cake batter to 9-inch pan and remaining cake batter (about 9 cups) to 12-inch pan; spread batter evenly in pans. Place 6- and 9-inch cake pans on top rack in oven and 12-inch cake pan on bottom rack in oven. Bake cakes until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes for 6- and 9-inch cakes and about 55 minutes for 12-inch cake. Cool cakes in pans on racks 30 minutes. Cut around cakes; turn out onto racks. Peel off parchment paper; cool cakes completely. Slide cakes onto corresponding cardboard rounds. Wrap cakes with foil; let stand at room temperature 1 day. Place white chocolate in large metal bowl; set over large saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water). Stir until chocolate is almost melted. Remove from over water; stir until chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Cool chocolate to room temperature, stirring occasionally. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in very large bowl (at least 8-quart capacity) until smooth. Gradually beat in butter. Beat in cooled white chocolate in 4 additions. Beat in vanilla and almond extracts. Add only enough gel base color in rice-size drops, beating to blend after each addition, to turn frosting pale pink. Using long serrated knife, cut 12-inch cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Using large tart pan bottom as aid, transfer 2 top layers, 1 at a time, to work surface, leaving bottom layer on cardboard. Spread 2/3 cup preserves over bottom cake layer, leaving 1/2-inch border at edge. Arrange 1 1/2 cups berries on their sides atop preserves, spacing apart and pressing gently to flatten. Spoon 2 cups frosting by dollops over berries. Using spatula, gently spread frosting to cover cake and berries evenly. Using tart pan bottom as aid, slide middle cake layer atop filling. Repeat layering of preserves, berries and frosting. Top with third cake layer, cut side down. Spread 2 2/3 cups frosting smoothly over top and sides of cake; refrigerate on cardboard base. Using serrated knife, cut 9-inch cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Using tart pan bottom as aid, transfer 2 top layers, 1 at a time, to work surface. Spread 7 tablespoons preserves over bottom cake layer, leaving 1/2-inch border at edge. Arrange 1 cup berries on their sides atop preserves, spacing apart and pressing gently to flatten. Spoon 1 1/4 cups frosting by dollops over berries. Using spatula, gently spread frosting to cover cake and berries evenly. Using tart pan bottom as aid, slide middle cake layer atop filling. Repeat layering of preserves, berries and frosting. Top with third cake layer, cut side down. Spread 2 1/4 cups frosting smoothly over top and sides of cake; refrigerate on cardboard base. Using serrated knife, cut 6-inch cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Transfer 2 top layers, 1 at a time, to work surface. Spread 3 tablespoons preserves over bottom cake layer, leaving 1/2-inch border at edge. Arrange generous 1/3 cup berries on their sides atop preserves, spacing apart and pressing gently to flatten. Spoon 1/3 cup frosting by dollops over berries. Using spatula, gently spread frosting to cover cake and berries evenly. Place middle cake layer atop filling. Repeat layering of preserves, berries and frosting. Top with third cake layer, cut side down. Spread 1 cup frosting smoothly over top and sides of cake; refrigerate on cardboard base. Transfer remaining frosting to medium metal bowl; cover and refrigerate. Chill assembled cakes until frosting is firm, about 2 hours. (Remaining frosting can be refrigerated up to 1 week.) Cut each package of fondant into 8 equal 4-ounce pieces. Wrap all but 3 1/2 pieces (14 ounces) in plastic wrap and reserve for 9-inch and 12-inch cakes. Break reserved 3 1/2 pieces fondant into 1-inch pieces. Drop fondant pieces into bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beating until blended and malleable, about 1 minute. Remove 1 walnut-size piece of softened fondant from bowl. Dip toothpick into gel base color; smear color onto walnut-size piece of fondant. Knead briefly with hands to incorporate color evenly. Repeat, adding more color with toothpick and kneading until fondant piece is bright pink. Add 1/4-inch piece of bright pink fondant to bowl of white fondant and beat to blend well, adding more bright pink fondant by 1/4-inch pieces as necessary and blending until fondant in bowl is pale pink. Shape pale pink fondant into disk. Wrap bright pink fondant in plastic to keep soft. Place assembled 6-inch cake on turntable. Roll out disk of pale pink fondant on sheet of parchment paper to 11-inch round. Once the fondant has been rolled out, drape it over a large rolling pin to transfer it from the work surface to the cake. Loosely roll fondant around rolling pin. Hold rolling pin over cake; release enough fondant to touch base of cake at 1 side. Unroll fondant over cake so that it drapes evenly on all sides. Gently press fondant to top of cake. Resting base of thumb and heel of same hand on top edge of cake, barely press fondant to side of cake at 1 point. Place fingertips of other hand under skirt of fondant just below that point. In a slow but continuous motion, use upper hand to mold fondant to side of cake, smoothing wrinkles and folds. At same time, use lower hand to gently support and guide skirt of fondant. Fondant should cover cake smoothly, with excess flaring at bottom like brim of top hat. Cut off excess fondant at bottom of cake. Refrigerate 6-inch cake on cardboard base. Repeat blending and coloring with 6 pieces (24 ounces) of reserved fondant and 1/4-inch pieces of bright pink fondant. Place assembled 9-inch cake on turntable. Roll out disk of pale pink fondant on large sheet of parchment paper to 15-inch round. Follow above instructions for covering cake with fondant. Refrigerate 9-inch cake on cardboard base. Repeat blending and coloring with 10 1/2 pieces (42 ounces) reserved fondant and 1/4-inch pieces bright pink fondant (reserve remaining fondant for another use). Place assembled 12-inch cake on turntable. Roll out disk of pale pink fondant on large sheet of parchment paper to 18-inch round. Follow above instructions for covering cake with rolled fondant. Refrigerate 12-inch cake on cardboard base. (Fondant-covered cakes can be made ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 3 days, or double-wrap in plastic and freeze up to 1 week. Thaw frozen wrapped cakes over-night in refrigerator.) Place 12-inch cake on work surface. Insert 1 plastic straw straight down into center of cake. Using pen, mark straw 1/8 inch above fondant. Remove straw and cut with scissors at marked point. Cut 4 more straws to same length. Press 4 cut straws into cake, positioning about 3 1/2 inches in from edge and spacing evenly. Press 1 cut straw into center. Place 9-inch cake on work surface. Insert 1 plastic straw straight down into center of cake. Mark straw 1/8 inch above fondant. Remove straw and cut at marked point. Cut 3 more straws to same length. Press 3 cut straws into cake, positioning 2 1/2 inches in from edge and spacing evenly. Press 1 cut straw into center. Place 9-inch cake on cardboard atop straws in 12-inch cake. Place 6-inch cake on cardboard atop straws in 9-inch cake. Place bowl of remaining frosting directly over low heat for 5 seconds to soften frosting slightly. Whisk frosting to blend. Repeat warming as needed until frosting is just soft enough to pipe. Spoon some frosting into pastry bag fitted with 1/8-inch plain round tip. Pipe small dots in small repetitive triangle pattern on sides of cakes. Spoon some frosting into pastry bag fitted with 1/4-inch plain round tip. Pipe big dots of frosting, side by side, around base of 6-inch, 9-inch and 12-inch tiers. Arrange flowers decoratively on cake tiers. (Fully assembled wedding cake can be completed 6 hours ahead. Let stand at cool room temperature.) Remove top and middle cake tiers. Remove straws from middle tier. Cut top and middle tiers into slices. Remove straws from bottom tier. Starting 3 inches in from edge and cutting straight down from top to bottom, cut 6-inch-diameter circle in center of tier. Cut outer portion into slices; cut inner 6-inch portion into slices. Transfer cake slices to plates and serve.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Gingerbread House. Ingredients: 6 3/4 cups all purpose flour, 4 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1 1/2 cups solid vegetable shortening, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup robust (dark) molasses, 1 roll kitchen parchment (at least 10 yards long sold at cookware stores and at some supermarkets), 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter for roof tiles, Assorted cookie cutters (such as Christmas tree, gingerbread man, and star), 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 6 cardboard sheets (about 15 X 15 inches), Waxed paper, Instructions: Sift flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt and cardamom into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat shortening in large bowl until fluffy. Add sugar and beat to blend. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Add molasses and beat on high speed until well blended. Add dry ingredients in 4 additions, beating at low speed until dough forms. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Flatten each piece into rectangle. Wrap each in plastic and refrigerate until firm enough to roll, at least 6 hours. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.) Each of the six pieces of dough will be used for one of the large sections of the house (the two side walls, the front and the back walls, and the two roof sections). The scraps will be rerolled to make the roof tiles, trees, stars, figures and other cookies for nibbling. On one cardboard sheet, draw 14-inch round and cut out, making base for house. On another cardboard sheet, draw one 7- X 10-inch rectangle and cut out. Outline rectangle 3 more times on cardboard sheets and cut out, making 4 foundation rectangles. Draw one 6- X 9-inch rectangle on cardboard sheet and cut out, making roof template. Draw one 7- X 4-inch rectangle on cardboard sheet and cut out, making side wall template. Cut out 2 (1 1/2-inch) squares for windows. To make the template for the front and back of the house, draw a 4- X 5-inch rectangle on cardboard sheet, then use the 5-inch side of the rectangle as the base for a triangle with the opposite angle 4 inches away from base. To make a door, cut a 1 1/2- X 2 3/4-inch rectangle in the center of the opposite 5-inch side of rectangle. Preheat oven to 350F. Roll out 1 dough piece (keep remaining dough refrigerated) between two 15-inch-long sheets of parchment to scant 1/4-inch rectangle, turning over dough and parchment occasionally. If parchment wrinkles, peel off, smooth wrinkle and reposition parchment over dough; continue to roll out dough to required thickness. To make roof, place cardboard roof template atop parchment. Using small sharp knife, cut around template through top sheet of parchment to make 6x9-inch rectangle. Peel top parchment off dough. Pull away excess dough from around the rectangle. Slide dough rectangle on its bottom parchment onto heavy large baking sheet. Gather dough scraps; wrap in plastic and refrigerate. Bake rectangle until dry looking, firm to touch in center and just beginning to darken around edges, about 13 minutes. Slide parchment with rectangle onto rack and cool completely. Rinse baking sheet under cold water to cool; wipe dry. Repeat rolling, cutting and baking of each remaining 5 large dough pieces, 1 piece at a time, to make second roof section, 2 side walls, front wall and back wall (cut out windows on side walls and door on front wall but not door on back wall). Gather and refrigerate dough scraps for use later and rinse baking sheet to cool each time. Roll out some of reserved dough scraps between sheets of parchment to 1/8-inch thickness. Peel off top parchment. Using floured 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out rounds for roof tiles. Using small knife as aid, cut and pull away dough from between rounds. Slide parchment with cookie rounds onto cooled baking sheet. Bake cookies until dry looking and firm to touch, about 9 minutes. Slide parchment with cookies onto rack and cool cookies. Working in batches, repeat with more reserved dough to roll, cut and bake a total of 50 round cookies, gathering, wrapping and chilling any dough scraps each time. Roll out some of reserved dough between sheets of parchment to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out 2 1/2x1 1/2-inch rectangle for front door. Using floured cookie cutters, cut out several stars, gingerbread figures, Christmas trees and other decorative shapes as desired. Using small knife as aid, pull or cut away dough from around door and between shapes. Slide parchment with cookies onto cooled baking sheet. Bake cookies until dry looking and firm to touch, about 9 minutes. Slide parchment with cookies onto rack and cool cookies completely. Remove all baked gingerbread from parchment. (All gingerbread can be prepared 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.) You will prepare this recipe twice: once for assembling the gingerbread house, and again for decorating it. 4 large egg whites 7 to 7 1/2 cups powdered white sugar Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in medium bowl until very foamy, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Beat until well blended. Add remaining cups sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, beating until well blended after each addition and scraping down sides of bowl occasionally. Beat icing at high speed until very thick and stiff, about 5 minutes. (Second batch of icing will be made later.) Assembly of Foundation and Walls 2 pastry bags 1 1/4- to 3/8-inch diameter plain round pastry tip Place 14-inch round cardboard base on work surface. Spoon some icing into pastry bag fitted with 1/4- to 3/8-inch diameter tip; cover icing in bowl tightly to prevent drying. Pipe a small dab of icing in center of round. Place one 7x10-inch cardboard foundation rectangle on icing; press to adhere. Pipe small mound of icing in center of rectangle. Place second 7x10-inch cardboard rectangle over; press to adhere. Repeat with more icing and remaining two 7x10-inch rectangles, forming the foundation for house in center of round cardboard base. Pipe thick line of icing on bottom edge of 1 side wall. Stand wall on cardboard foundation, icing side down, 1 inch in from and parallel to one long side and 2 inches in from one short side; hold for 5 minutes. Pipe thick line of icing onto front edge of wall. Press back edge of front wall (with door cutout) into icing on front edge of side wall. Hold pieces together for 5 minutes. Pipe thick line of icing on bottom edge and up front edge of second side wall. Press icing on front edge of side wall into the back edge of front wall, positioning wall parallel to first side wall. Hold for 5 minutes. Pipe line of icing up back edge of each side wall. Press edges of back wall (without door) into icing, forming the back of the house. Hold 5 minutes to set. Pipe lines of icing inside house at 4 intersections of walls, along the base and on outside at all vertical joints to reinforce. Pipe a thick line of icing along 1 long edge of front-door cookie. Attach cookie to left side of door opening in front wall, creating an opened front door. Pipe any icing left in pastry bag back into bowl of icing. Cover tightly; store at room temperature to use for decorating later. Let house stand until icing is completely dry and very hard about 12 hours. 1 1/8-inch diameter plain round pastry tip 1 1/4- to 3/8-inch diameter plain round pastry tip 2 pastry bags Prepare a second batch of icing. Beat in any remaining icing from the first batch. Spoon 1 cup icing into pastry bag fitted with 1/8-inch diameter tip. Outline windows and front door decoratively. Pipe decorations on front and back walls. Spoon icing into a new pastry bag fitted with 1/4- to 3/8-inch diameter plain tip. Pipe thick line of icing down 1 diagonal edge of front wall; continue piping icing along top edge of adjoining side wall and up diagonal edge of back wall. Press 1 roof rectangle into icing, positioning so that top edge aligns with tops of front and back walls and lower edge overhangs side wall by about 1 1/4 inches. Hold in position for 5 minutes to set. Pipe additional lines of icing along roof joints inside house to reinforce. Pipe thick line of icing down second diagonal edge of front wall; continue piping icing along top edge of adjoining side wall and up diagonal edge of back wall. Press second roof rectangle into icing, positioning so that top edge aligns with edge of first roof rectangle and lower edge overhangs side wall by about 1 1/4 inches. Hold in position for 5 minutes to set. Let house stand until icing hardens, at least 3 hours. Cover bowl of icing and let stand at room temperature. Spoon more icing into pastry bag fitted with 1/4- to 3/8-inch diameter plain tip. Pipe small mound of icing in center of underside of 1 round cookie. Align cookie edges flush with one bottom corner of roof; press to adhere. Repeat with about 5 more cookies to form bottom row of roof tiles, cutting end cookie to align with edge of roof. Pipe generous mound of icing on upper half of underside of 1 round cookie. Position cookie halfway between 2 first row cookies and overlapping them by about 3/4-inch. Press icing portion gently onto roof. Repeat with more cookies to form second row; cutting cookies to fit at each end. Repeat with more cookies to cover first side of roof. Attach cookies in same way on second roof rectangle. Using first pastry bag fitted with 1/8-inch-diameter tip, outline the bottom halves and cut edges of roof tiles with icing. 12 hard red-and-white striped peppermint candies, cut in half with serrated knife 4 striped candy canes, cut to fit corners of house under roof Cinnamon imperials Chocolate nonpareils Other assorted candies Spoon icing into pastry bag fitted with 1/4- to 3/8-inch-diameter tip. Pipe 1 or more thick lines of frosting between roof sections at top of house, filling opening completely. Gently press cut side of peppermint candies in row into icing. Pipe 1 thick vertical line of icing at each corner of house; press 1 trimmed candy cane into each. Pipe small rounds of icing onto both sides of door for doorknobs and in center of each roof tile. Press cinnamon imperials into each round of icing. Using pastry bag fitted with 1/8-inch-diameter tip, pipe small mound of icing onto edge of roof. Slowly pull bag downward while squeezing out icing so that about 3/4- to 1-inch section of icing hangs freely. Pull bag away, leaving ""icicle"" hanging. Repeat at 1/4-inch intervals around roof edge. Pipe decorative line of icing along front and back eaves of roof sections. Outline and decorate gingerbread figures, trees, stars and other cookies. (Icing may be colored, if desired.) Using back of spoon or flexible spatula, spread icing around base of house and on cardboard base, creating ""snow-covered"" landscape. Press chocolate nonpareils into icing, making path to front door. Stand decorated cookies in icing.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Cannelloni with Asparagus and Ham. Ingredients: 2 pounds asparagus, 6 tablespoons butter, 1 cup water, Salt, 6 ounces boiled unsmoked ham, 3 cups milk, 6 tablespoons butter, 4 1/2 tablespoons flour, Pinch salt, 1 cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano (Parmesan), 1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg, 2 large eggs, About 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour, Instructions: Trim 1 inch or more off the butt ends of the asparagus, leaving only the moist, tender part of the stalk. Pare away the tough green skin from the base of the spear to the end of the stalk. Remove any tiny leaves sprouting below the base of the tip. Cut the trimmed asparagus into 2-inch lengths and wash in cold water. Choose a lidded, shallow pan large enough to accommodate all the asparagus. Put in 4 tablespoons of the butter, the water, a little salt, and the asparagus. Cover and turn on the heat to medium. Cook until the asparagus is tender, but firm. If, when the asparagus is done, there is still liquid in the pan, uncover, raise the heat to high, and boil away the liquid while browning the asparagus lightly. Cut up the ham and chop it in a food processor, but take care not to chop it too fine. Add the asparagus to the processor bowl and run the processor very briefly once or twice. The asparagus should be cut up into small pieces, but not blended to a creamy consistency. Make the bechamel: Heat the milk over low heat until it forms a ring of pearly bubbles, but do not let it break into a boil. While the milk is being heated, melt the butter in a separate pan over low heat. When the butter melts, add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. When the flour has been wholly amalgamated with the butter, but before it becomes colored, remove from the heat. Add 2 tablespoons of milk at a time to the flour and butter mixture, stirring steadily and thoroughly. Add 2 more tablespoons of milk when the first 2 have been incorporated smoothly and evenly into the butter and flour. Stir and repeat the operation until you have put in 8 tablespoons of milk. At this point you can add the milk 1/2 cup at a time, always stirring steadily to obtain a homogeneous mixture. When all the milk has been worked in, place the pan over low heat, add the pinch of salt, and stir without interruption until the bechamel is as dense as a thick cream. Put the chopped asparagus and ham in a bowl, add half the bechamel, 2/3 cup of the grated cheese, and the nutmeg. Mix well. Knead the dough for the pasta and thin it out, stopping at the next to last setting on the machine, as described below. Cut the pasta strips into 5- to 6-inch-long rectangles, leaving them as wide as they come from the machine. Parboil them, rinse them, and spread on dry cloth towels. Turn on the oven to 450. Choose a baking pan large enough (about to by 12 inches) to contain all the cannelloni snugly in a single layer. Smear the bottom generously with butter. Spread 1 tablespoon of bechamel on a plate. Place a rectangle of pasta over the bechamel, rotating it lightly so that its underside becomes coated. Over the pastas top side spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the asparagus mixture, thinning it evenly, but stopping just short of the edge of the pasta. Roll up the pasta softly, jelly-roll fashion, to form a cannellone. Place the cannellone in the pan, with the overlapping edge facing down. Repeat the operation, laying the cannelloni snugly side to side, until all the cannelloni are done. From time to time, smear more bechamel over the bottom of the plate, as necessary, but take care not to use up all the bechamel. When all the cannelloni are in the pan, spread the remaining bechamel over them, forcing some of the sauce into the spaces between the cannelloni. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/3 cup of grated cheese and dot with the leftover 2 tablespoons of butter. Place the pan in the uppermost level of the preheated oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until a golden brown crust forms on top. Allow to settle for 5 to 8 minutes before serving. To serve, do not cut into the cannelloni, but loosen them, one from the other, with a spatula. Making Pasta at Home by Machine THE FLOUR As Elizabeth David has demonstrated magnificently, one can write a volume about varieties of flour. When we focus on Italian cooking, however, and specifically on pasta, we limit our field to two basic kinds: soft-wheat, unbleached, all-purpose flour and durum or hard-wheat flour, also known as semolina or, in Italian, semola. The first is white, the second pale yellow. Each of the two varieties has its virtues and drawbacks. For the classic pasta of Bologna, stretched by hand with a rolling pin, only soft-wheat flour is used. It is lower in gluten than semolina, hence it is easier to hand stretch. Soft wheat has a gentler, warmer fragrance than that of semolinas, which is faintly sharp. The sweet-smelling pasta it produces is plumper in body and of a fluffier consistency than any made with durum wheat flour. On the other hand, it requires utmost heedfulness in the cooking, because it can quickly pass that dangerous line from firm to overdone. Semolina has so much tough gluten that it is next to impossible to stretch by hand in the Bolognese manner. It is more suitable for flat pasta compressed by a non-extruding home machine or for such industrially extruded shapes as spaghetti or fusilli. Pasta made with semolina flour is never as downy as the soft-wheat kind, but it makes up for it with a body tautly knit and admirably compact. It accepts an extraordinary variety of sauces and cooks to a perfect al dente, firm-to-the-bite consistency. When buying semolina one must look out for flour that is ground too coarse. Unfortunately much of it is, including some brands that are sold as pasta flour. It should be talcum soft to the touch and impalpable, like other flour; otherwise it will be difficult to work with. At home I use semolina when I want extra firmness, such as in tonnarelli. More frequently I use all-purpose, unbleached flour, which makes pasta closer to that made at home in Bologna. The choice, however, depends on ones preferences. Both flours make equally valid pasta. THE DOUGH INGREDIENTS. The dough for homemade pasta consists of flour and eggs, nothing else. The only exception is when spinach or Swiss chard leaves are added to the basic egg and flour dough to make green pasta. Olive oil, salt, colorings, seasonings have no gastronomic reason for being in pasta. Some, such as olive oil that makes pasta slicker, are wholly undesirable and a detriment to good pasta. If one respects the freshness and immediacy of the Italian approach to cooking, one puts all flavors and seasonings in the sauce. PROPORTIONS. Use 1 cup of flour with 2 large eggs to produce approximately 3/4 pound of pasta. The exact ratio, however, will vary depending on the size of the eggs, their flour absorption capacity, even on the humidity of the environment. COMBINING THE EGGS AND FLOUR. Since you can never tell in advance exactly how much flour you will need, do not mix the flour and eggs in a bowl. You may find you want to use less flour than you thought. Pour the flour onto a work surface, shape it into a mound, scooping out a deep hollow in its center. Break the eggs into the hollow. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork as though you were making an omelet. Draw some of the flour over the eggs, mixing it, a little at a time, until the eggs are no longer runny. Draw the sides of the mound together, pushing to one side any flour you think you may not use. Work the mixture of flour and eggs with your fingers and the palms of your hands until it is well amalgamated. If it is still too moist, work in more flour as needed. Put the egg and flour mass to one side and scrape the work surface clean of all loose or caked bits of flour and of any crumbs of dough. Wash your hands and dry them. You are now ready to knead. MAKING SPINACH DOUGH. For approximately 1 pound of green pasta, use 2 large eggs, approximately 1 1/2 cups flour, and either 1/2 pound fresh spinach or half a 10-ounce package frozen leaf spinach. If using fresh spinach, trim away all the stems and wash the leaves in several changes of cold water to remove every trace of soil. Cook it in a covered pan over medium heat with only the water that clings to the leaves and with 1/4 teaspoon of salt to keep its color bright. Cook until tender, 15 minutes or more, drain, and let cool. If using frozen leaf spinach, cook it in a covered pan with 1/4 teaspoon of salt until tender. Drain and let cool. Squeeze all the liquid out of the cooked spinach with your hands, then chop it very fine. Follow the directions given for combining eggs and flour; beat the chopped spinach into the eggs in the well of flour before drawing any flour over them. KNEADING THE DOUGH. Kneading dough may be the single most important step in making good pasta. It is best done by hand, which takes no more, and possibly less, time and effort than with a machine, if you include the work required to clean the machine. Return to the egg and flour mass you had set aside. Push against it with the heel of your palm, keeping your fingers bent, fold it in half, give it a half turn, press hard again, and proceed thus for at least 8 minutes, pressing, folding, turning. If you are not sure that you have put in enough flour, push a finger into the dough as far as its center. It should come out clean and dry. If it is moist or there are bits of dough stuck to the finger, work in what additional flour you judge the dough needs. Unless you are ready to run the dough through the machine immediately, wrap it airtight in plastic wrap. Do not refrigerate it, but be ready to proceed with making the pasta within 2 or 3 hours at most. THE MACHINE THE TWO ADMISSIBLE KINDS. The basic pasta machine has paired steel rollers of two types: one is smooth and serves to compress and thin out the dough; the second set has parallel grooves that can cut the flattened dough into ribbons. Of this last set there are always two different pairs, a broad-grooved one that produces fettuccine and a narrower one that makes tagliolini. A movable handle can be inserted into different positions depending which of the rollers is to be turned. Less common now than it was before the introduction of the wretched extruding machines is the electric machine made by Bialetti. It works on the same principle as the hand-cranked version, over which it has two major advantages: the rollers are of plastic material with a gritty surface that makes pasta with a livelier texture and better sauce-absorbing qualities; it is electrically driven and faster so that it is both easier to use and kinder to the dough, which wants to be worked as rapidly as possible. No other kinds of machines than these two are suitable for making pasta at home. Those who already own a hand-operated machine can now buy an ingenious little motor that replaces the crank, converting any hand-turned machine into an electrically driven one. ROLLING OUT THE DOUGH WITH THE MACHINE. Flattening a ball of dough into a thin sheet is the pasta machines primary function. To perform it, it has several settings that bring the thinning rollers gradually closer together. Thinning the dough can be compared to reaching the sidewalk from a buildings sixth story. The fastest way is to jump, but you will be a mass of shattered bones. One of the reasons that pasta made by shops is generally so mediocre is that the dough is flattened all at one time, rather than step by step: its body is smashed, its vital sinew broken, it is inert. Walking down the steps is one safe way: it corresponds to the heedful use of the machines graduated thinning notches. Even less jarring would be to take the elevator: in making pasta, that would be the hand-stretched method. If you are thinning a ball of dough made with 2 eggs, divide it into 4 equal parts, or proportionally more parts if it is a larger amount. Cover the counter beside the machine with clean, dry, cloth kitchen towels. Set the thinning rollers at their maximum opening. Flatten 1 of the pieces of dough with your open hand and run it through the machine. Fold it in thirds, give it a quarter turn, and pass it through the machine again. Repeat the operation 2 or 3 times, then lay the flattened pasta strip on the towels. Take another piece of dough and flatten it as described above. Lay it next to the previously flattened strip on the towel, but do not let them overlap or touch. When all the dough has been flattened you can begin to thin it progressively. Close the opening of the rollers one notch and run the first of the flattened strips through it once. Do not fold it, but lay it flat on the towel. Repeat the procedure with all the other flattened pasta strips. When all are done, close the opening down another notch and thin all the strips again as has just been described. Continue thinning the pasta one notch at a time until it reaches the desired thinness. (Note: If you are making stuffed pasta, and you work slowly, take each piece of dough all the way through the thinning process, stuff it, then do the next piece. Keep the dough waiting to be thinned wrapped in plastic wrap.) CUTTING THE PASTA. If you are making lasagne, cannelloni, and any stuffed pasta, use the pasta immediately, as described in the appropriate recipe. For any pasta that encloses a stuffing, such as tortelli, tortellini, raviolini, the pasta must be cut and stuffed as soon as it is made, while it is still soft and sticky. Its softness makes it easier to shape and the stickiness is necessary to produce a tight seal, preventing the stuffing from spilling out during the cooking. For any kind of noodle, however, allow the strips to dry on the towels for 10 minutes or more, depending on the temperature and air circulation of your kitchen. Turn the strips over from time to time. The pasta is ready when it is still soft and pliant enough that it wont crack when cut, but not so moist that the noodles will stick to each other. Use the broad cutters on the machine to make fettuccine, and the narrower ones to make tagliolini. Tagliatelle, the classic Bolognese noodle, is slightly broader than fettuccine. If you are set on duplicating the Bolognese model, the pasta strips must be rolled up loosely and cut by hand into 1/4-inch-wide ribbons.","```cypher
