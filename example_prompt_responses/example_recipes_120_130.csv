"Recipe Name: Tet Sticky Rice Cakes. Ingredients: 5 1/4 cups long-grain sticky rice, 16 dried bamboo leaves, 1 1/2 tablespoons salt, 1 1/4 pounds boneless pork leg with skin and fat or pork shoulder, 3 tablespoons fish sauce, 2 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, preferably freshly ground, 12 pieces fresh or thawed, frozen banana leaf, each 5 by 10 inches, trimmed, rinsed, and wiped dry, 1 tablespoon canola or other neutral oil, 4 cups lightly packed Ground Steamed Mung Bean (page 322), Sugar, Canola or other neutral oil if frying cakes, Instructions: The night before, soak the rice and bamboo leaves. Put the rice in a large bowl and add water to cover by 2 inches. Place the bamboo leaves in a large roasting pan and add water to cover. Put a plate on top of the leaves to keep them submerged. The next morning, drain the rice in a colander and then return it to the bowl. (It will have swollen to more than 8 cups.) Gradually mix in the salt, sprinkling it over the rice and using your hands to distribute it well. Cut the pork into pieces the size of a deck of cards, about 3 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick. If you are using pork leg, each piece should have some fat and skin. Add the fish sauce, pepper, and pork to a bowl and mix well. Let marinate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, drain the bamboo leaves. Follow these directions, which will make sense when you assemble the cakes: Take each leaf and fold it lengthwise along the spine (dull side out) and then in half crosswise. Measuring from the center fold, use scissors to cut the leaf to measure 4 3/4 inches; unfolded, the trimmed leaf is 9 1/2 inches long. Use a ruler or one of the inner edges of the wooden mold (which is 5 inches long) as your guide. Rinse the trimmed leaves and set aside with the banana leaves. To cook the pork, in a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the meat in a single layer and all the marinade. Cook, turning once, for about 2 minutes on each side, or until the pork is just cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Divide it into 4 equal portions and set aside. Fill a 12-quart stockpot half full with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and cover to keep hot. To make each cake, put a 12-by-18-inch piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil on your work surface, with a short side closest to you. Place the mold on the center of the foil. You will need 4 bamboo leaves to form the framecorners and edgesfor the cake. Working on one corner at a time, fold a bamboo leaf lengthwise (dull side out) along the spine and then in half crosswise. Crease the center fold. To form a 90-degree corner, simply unwrap the leaf and bring the lower center crease up to meet the spine. The leaf now looks like an upright corner of a paper box. Place the folded bamboo leaf into one of the corners of the mold, with the ends pointing toward (or touching) two of the walls. Repeat with the remaining 3 bamboo leaves, going in one direction around the mold and overlapping the leaves as you go. When you are done, the leaves will look like a picture frame. Push the leaves down into the corners to make sure they are snug and flush. Straighten any slouching leaf. Next, line the mold with banana leaf. Place a piece of banana leaf so that one of its short sides is flush with the inner wall of the mold that is closest to you; the banana leaf should cover the bottom and extend above the mold on the far wall. Place a second piece of leaf in the reverse direction. The 2 pieces will overlap each other on the bottom. Equal lengths of leaf should extend above the mold on the far and near walls. Then arrange a third piece of leaf, with a long side closest to you, evenly across the bottom of the mold, so that short lengths of leaf extend above the right and left walls. All 4 walls of the mold are now lined. Use your fingers to tuck the leaves into the mold. To add the edible ingredients, first scoop up 1 cup of the rice and pour it into the mold. Use your fingers to push some rice toward the outer edges. Add 1/2 cup lightly packed mung bean, pouring it into the center. Center a portion of pork on top. (If you are using pork leg, position the fat and skin in the center, so that at serving time, everyone gets an equal amount. You may need to tear or cut some of the fat from the meat to create an equal distribution.) Top with another 1/2 cup lightly packed mung bean. Finish with 1 cup rice. The mold will look very full. Push some of the rice to the sides and corners. Cover the top of the cake by folding in the side flaps of banana leaf, then fold the side farthest from you down, and finally fold over the side nearest you. Press down firmly on the cake with your hand to distribute and compact the ingredients. Once the top is relatively flat, put one hand on top of the cake to hold it in place while you gently pull off the mold with the other hand. Temporarily keep the mold on your lower arm while you fold the top flap of foil down, and then fold the bottom flap up and over. This should keep the cake in place enough for you to remove the mold from your arm. Then, as if wrapping a gift , fold in the sides to form a foiled-covered square box. Pick up the cake and gently tap the sides against your work surface to make sure the elements are set. Put the cake aside. Repeat to make the remaining 3 cakes. Save or discard left over rice. Tie each cake together with kitchen string. Since the rice expands during cooking, dont tie too tightly. Th e string should not make an impression in the foil. (See illustration, page 264.) Return the stockpot of water to a boil. Add the cakes, stacking and/or standing them up. To keep the cakes from floating, place an empty saucepan on top to weight them down gently. Return the water to a boil and cook, uncovered, for 7 hours. To maintain the boil, keep a kettle of boiled water on the stove to replenish the water as needed; it is okay if the water occasionally simmers. As the cakes cook, they will expand and gain weight. Every 2 hours, rotate the cakes so they will cook evenly. When the cakes no longer float, about midway through the full cooking time, remove the saucepan and continue boiling. Use tongs to transfer the cooked cakes to a baking sheet, placing the best-looking square side down. Put another baking sheet on top and center a 14- or 15-ounce food can on each cake to weight it down. (Eager people let the cakes cool for only 1 to 2 hours before unwrapping and eating.) The next morning, remove the foil, wipe off stray bits of rice, and then wrap each cake in plastic wrap. For display purposes, you may tie colorful ribbon (red symbolizes good luck) around each cake. The cakes may be kept at room temperature for 3 days, beyond which they should be stored in the refrigerator, where they will last for a week. They may also be frozen for up to 3 months (see Note for information on how to refresh frozen cakes). There are two ways to enjoy banh chung: soft , which allows you to appreciate fully the pale green color and ethereal flavor of the banana leaf, or fried into a delicious crispy pancake. Regardless of which method you use, serve the cake with sugar for lightly dipping the pieces. It sounds odd but is quite nice. To cut and serve a cake soft: Cut the cake into 8 equal triangular wedges (think of an asterisk). Because it is hard to cut through the sticky rice with a knife, Vietnamese cooks use a type of fibrous string. I substitute unflavored dental floss or linen kitchen string. (If the cake is firm from refrigeration, unwrap and cut with a knife. Reheat the pieces in a microwave oven until soft before serving.) To cut with floss or twine: Undo the plastic wrap, keeping it spread out underneath the cake. Remove and discard the bamboo leaves. Return the cake to the plastic wrap, open side up (as it was when you were assembling the cake). Peel off the top and side flaps of banana leaf, leaving them on the plastic wrap. Cut 4 lengths of floss or string each about 20 inches long and arrange them on the cake in the pattern of an 8-spoked asterisk: position 2 strands on the diagonals, 1 strand horizontally across the middle, and 1 strand vertically down the middle. One at a time, grab the ends of each strand and pull the strand down about 1/4 inch into the cake to secure it in place. Invert the cake onto a serving plate. (Use the plastic wrap to pick up the cake.) Peel off the plastic wrap and banana leaves. One at a time, grab each strand by its ends and pull it up through the cake toward the center, crossing in the middle and lifting it out of the cake. (You may have to pause midway to pull on other strands as you make the cuts.) When all the strands are removed, the cake will be cut into perfect wedges. To fry and serve a cake: Nicely cut wedges are not necessary if you are frying the cake. Use a knife to quarter the cake and then cut each quarter into 1/2-inch-thick slices. In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add half of the slices and fry, undisturbed, for about 6 minutes, or until the rice has softened. Use a spatula to press and mash the chunks to form a pancake and continue to fry for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the underside is crispy and golden. Flip the pancake with a quick and confident jerk of the skillet handle (or slide the pancake onto a plate and then invert it into the skillet). Increase the heat to medium-high and fry the second side for about 4 minutes, or until crispy and golden. Slide the pancake onto a plate, cut into wedges, and serve. Repeat with the remaining slices to make a second pancake. The wooden mold for these cakes is not commercially produced because people typically make the molds themselves. If you are not good at woodworking, do as I did and ask someone for help. The mold should have a 5-inch-square opening and stand 1 1/2 inches high. (For my mold, I bought a 30-inch-long piece of 3/4-inch-thick unfinished oak from a spare wood bin at a lumberyard.) My friend Mike Crane cut the wood into 4 pieces, 2 pieces that were 5 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide and 2 pieces that were 6 1/2 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Although nails would have held the pieces together, he used screws, drilling 2 holes at the end of each of the longer pieces. When he screwed the pieces together, he added a little glue for extra security. To finish the mold, he lightly sanded the edges. To refresh a thawed banh chung, bring it to room temperature. Rewrap it in foil and tie it with cotton string as you originally did. Boil the cake in a large pot of water for 1 hour, adding water as needed to keep the cake submerged. Remove the cake and let cool for 1 to 2 hours before eating."

"Recipe Name: Crispy Tart with Fresh Fruit. Ingredients: Approximately 2 pounds classic puff pastry, recipe follows (or frozen), Pastry cream, flavored, recipe follows, 3/4 cup light corn syrup, 1/4 cup water, 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered, Assorted fresh fruit, sliced, Confectioners sugar, for dusting, Suggested presentation: Sugar cage, recipe follows, 4 cups unbleached flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled, 1/4 cup water, 1 1/4 cups butter, cold, 3 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 egg yolks, 1 cup whole milk, 1/2 vanilla bean, 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 2/3 cup light corn syrup, 1/2 cup water, Cooking spray, Instructions: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture. Using a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled. Using a pastry brush, coat one side of each cooled circle with the tempered chocolate and allow the chocolate to set at room temperature, about 5 minutes. This layer of chocolate keeps the tarts from getting soggy. When the chocolate has set, spread about 2 tablespoons of pastry cream on each tart shell on top the chocolate coating. Cover with assorted sliced fresh fruit. It looks best to arrange the fruit in a sunburst pattern, fanning each type of fruit from the center of the circle toward the edge. Sprinkle the tops of the tarts with powdered sugar right before you serve them. A great finish for this dessert is a sugar cage over the top. For the Classic Puff Pastry: Place the flour, salt, melted butter, and most of the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax. Work the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton. The paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and give it two more single folds, starting each time with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Make four indentations in the dough with your fingertips representing the four folds. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day. For the Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to add it. Cut the butter into small chunks and stir it in until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use Flavor the cream according to your taste. For example, with a whisk or spatula, slowly fold about 1 tablespoon of any flavored liqueur into the cream at any point in the recipe, tasting often. If you add too much, the cream will become runny and lose its shape. If you prefer to add flavor without alcohol, place the zest of 1 orange in the heating milk to infuse the flavor into the pastry cream. Store the pastry cream well wrapped in the refrigerator until ready to use. Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 311 degrees F, or what is known as the \\""hard crack\\"" stage. Remove from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-sized, microwave-able glass bowl. Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly coat with cooking spray a clean, dry bowl that matches the diameter of whatever youre placing the sugar cage over. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl, making sure to come all the way to the rim, however, not so thick that you cant see the bowl through the sugar. Using a sharp chefs knife, slice the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To unmold the cage, place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl; you will be able to see the cage release from the inside of the bowl. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside of the bowl. Once the cage has released from the bowl, carefully lift it out and place it over the dessert. If the sugar is still too warm, the cage may begin to collapse. A good idea is to release the cage from the bowl but leave it in the bowl until it has cooled completely. This will ensure that it keeps its shape. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for one to two days.) Chocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolates residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes."

Increase speed to medium-high, and add in sugar gradually, whipping till stiff peaks form. Transfer egg-white mix to a large bowl. Using a rubber spatula, fold egg-yolk mix into egg-white mix. Sift cocoa pwdr and flour over top, and gently mix in. Pour batter into prepared pan, and smooth top with an offset spatula. Bake till cake springs back when touched, 9 to 10 min. Remove pan from oven, and immediately turn cake out onto a wire rack lined with parchment paper. Peel parchment paper from top of cake, and cold completely. Make the White Chocolate Mousse: Dissolve gelatin in 1/4 c. cool water, and set aside for 5 min. Place chocolate in the bowl of a food processor, and pulse till very finely minced. Prepare an ice-water bath; set aside. Place 3/4 c. cream in a small saucepan, and bring just to a boil over medium-high heat. Add in gelatin, and stir for 30 seconds to dissolve completely. Pour into food processor with the motor running, and process till chocolate mix is smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl and place over ice water bath. Refrigeratetill mix is thick sufficient to fall from a spoon in ribbons. Whip remaining 1 3/4 c. heavy cream to soft peaks. Fold into chocolate mix. If not using immediately, chill in an airtight container. (Makes 5 1/2 c.) Place a clean kitchen towel on work surface. Transfer cake on parchment paper to towel. Using a pastry brush, coat cake with rum. Using an offset spatula, spread white-chocolate mousse over cake. Sprinkle with 1/2 c. freshly grated coconut. With a short end of cake facing you, roll carefully into a roulade. Wrap in a kitchen towel, and secure with clothespins or possibly large metal binder clips to hold the roll in a tight round shape. Place on a baking sheet, and chill till hard, at least 2 hrs. For the Snowy Chocolate Truffles: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Place almonds, if using, on a baking sheet, and toast till fragrant, about 10 min. Set aside to cold. Use a serrated knife to finely chop chocolate. Place in a heat-proof bowl; set aside. In a small saucepan, bring cream to a boil. Pour directly over minced chocolate, stirring to fully incorporate. Let sit for 10 min. Stir till completely smooth. Allow to cold for 20 min. Stir in almonds, if using, and place in the refrigerator till set. Use a melon baller or possibly 1 1/4-inch ice-cream scoop to portion out chocolate. Roll the mix between palms to create 1-inch truffles. Chill till ready to serve. Coat with confectioners sugar before serving. ( Makes about 50) For the Meringue Mushrooms: Make the Swiss Meringue: Fill a medium saucepan one-quarter full with water. Set over medium heat; bring water to a simmer. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar; place over saucepan. Whisk constantly till sugar is dissolved and whites are hot to the touch, about 3 min. Rub mix between fingers to test. Transfer bowl to mixer stand, and whip, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to high, till meringue is cold and stiff, glossy peaks form, about 10 min. Add in vanilla; mix till combined. Use immediately. (Makes 4 c.) Heat oven to 200 degrees. Place Swiss meringue in an 18-inch pastry bag fitted with a large 3/4-inch round tip. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Pipe meringue, forming domes 1 to 2 inches in diameter. Pipe a stem shape for each dome. Bake for 1 hour; reduce heat to 175 degrees, and continue baking till meringues are completely dry to the touch but not browned, 45 to 60 min more. Fill a medium saucepan one-quarter full with water. Set over medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Place bittersweet chocolate in a heat-proof bowl, and set over simmering water. Turn off heat; stir chocolate occasionally till completely melted. Using an offset spatula, spread bottoms of domed meringues with chocolate; let sit at room temperature. Place white chocolate in a heat-proof bowl, and set oversimmering water. Turn off heat; stir chocolate occasionally till completely melted. Allow to cold slightly. To create mushroom gills, spread white chocolate over dark chocolate; use a toothpick to create lines from the center of the caps underside to the edges. Let set in a cold, dry place. Poke a small hole in the center of each mushroom cap using a paring knife. Dip the pointed end of each of the mushroom stems in melted white chocolate, and insert into hole in center of cap. Allow to set. Meringue mushrooms should be kept in an airtight container in a cold, dry place. For the Seven Minute Frosting: In a small heavy saucepan, combine 3/4 c. sugar, the corn syrup, and 2 Tbsp. water. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, till the sugar has dissolved. Rub a bit between your fingers to make sure there is no graininess. Raise heat to bring to a boil. Dont stir anymore. Boil, washing down sides of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cool water from time to time to prevent the sugar from crystallizing, till a candy thermometer registers 230 degrees, about 5 min. (Depending on the humidity, this can take anywhere from 4 to 10 min.) Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk egg whites on medium speed till soft peaks form, about 2 1/2 min. Gradually add in the remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar. Remove the syrup from the heat when the temperature reaches 230 degrees (it will keep rising as pan is removed from heat). Pour the syrup in a steady stream down the side of the bowl (to avoid splattering) containing the egg-white mix, with the mixer on medium-low speed. Beat the frosting on medium speed till it is cold, 5 - 10 min. The frosting should be thick and shiny. Use immediately. This cake frosting is named for the length of time it must be beaten in the final stage. Have the cake you are going to frost already prepared before making this frosting; it must be spread on while the beaten egg whites and sugar are still pliable; once frosted, the cake may sit out for several hrs before being served. Dont chill. ( Makes about 5 1/2 c.) Remove cake roll from refrigerator, and unwrap. Using a serrated knife, trim the ends of the roll, cutting on the bias. Choose the more presentable end, and place it, cut-side up, on the log, forming a branch. If you like, use the other cut end for a second branch. Transfer the log to a serving platter. Slide 5-inch strips of parchment paper under the log to protect the tray while decorating. Coat with seven-minute frosting using an offset spatula. Remove parchment pcs. Decorate with meringue mushrooms, Snowy Chocolate Truffles, coconut shavings, and rosemary sprigs. This recipe yields 1 ten-by-five-inch log. Yield: 1 ten-by-five-inch log"
"Recipe Name: Wheaten Croissants. Ingredients: 2 cups/ 10 ounces/ 284 grams unbleached all purpose flour (use only Gold Medal, King Arthur or Pillsbury), 1 tablespoon/ 4 grams wheat germ, 2 teaspoons/ 2 grams wheat bran, 1 1/2 teaspoon/ 4.8 grams instant yeast, 2 tablespoons/ scant 1 ounce/ 25 grams sugar, 1 teaspoon/ 6.6 grams salt, 3/4 cup/ 6.3 ounces/ 181 grams milk, scalded and cooled to room temperature (70F to 90F), 12 tablespoons/6 ounces/ 170 grams unsalted butter, preferably a high-fat European-style butter, such as Vermont Cultured, Plugra or Land O Lakes ultra, 6 ounces/ 170 grams dark chocolate, such as Cluizel (60%), Valrhona Gastronomie (61%), or Scharffen Berger (62%) (For Pains au Chocolat), 1 large egg (3 tablespoons/2 ounces/ 56 grams), 1 tablespoon water, A heavy-duty mixer with dough hook attachment, 2 large baking sheets OR half sheet pans, lined with Silpat or parchment, Optional: two 18-by-2-inch-high sheet pans, for proof boxes, Instructions: Oven Temperature: 450F, then 400F Mix the flour, germ, and bran for the butter square. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of the flour, the wheat germ, and wheat bran. Cover and set aside. Make the dough. In the mixer bowl, whisk together the remaining flour, the yeast, and the sugar. Then whisk in the salt (this keeps the yeast from coming in direct contact with the salt, which would kill it). With the dough hook, add the milk and mix, starting on low speed (#2 if using KitchenAid), until the dry ingredients are moistened. Raise the speed to medium (#4 KitchenAid) and knead for 4 minutes. The dough will be silky-smooth and have pulled away from the sides of the bowl, but it will still cling to your fingers slightly. (The dough needs to be soft and not too elastic to make it easier to roll and so the butter package will not break through.) Place the dough in a 1-quart or larger food-storage container or bowl, lightly greased with cooking spray or oil. Press down the dough and lightly spray or oil the top. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75F to 80F) for 30 minutes. Using an oiled spatula, gently fold the dough by lifting it from the sides and pressing it into the middle to deflate it slightly. Cover and refrigerate it for a minimum of 2 hours, or up to overnight. Make the butter square. Place the bran mixture on a sheet of plastic wrap and put the butter on top of it. Wrap the plastic wrap loosely around it. Pound the butter lightly with a rolling pin to flatten and soften it, then knead it together with the bran mixture, using the plastic wrap and your knuckles to avoid touching the butter directly. Work quickly and as soon as the bran mixture is incorporated, shape it into a 4 1/2 -inch square (no thicker than 3/4 inch). At this point, the butter should still be cool but workable60F. Use it at once, or keep it cool. The butter must not be colder than 60F when rolled into the pastry, or it will break through the dough and not distribute evenly. A cool cellar, or a wine cellar, is an ideal place to maintain this temperature. Alternatively, refrigerate it, but then allow it to often slightly before using it. The butter should be cool but malleable. Roll the dough and make the butter package. Roll out the dough on a well-floured surface to an 8-inch square. Place the butter square diagonally in the center of the dough square and, with the back of the knife, lightly mark the dough along the edges of the butter. Remove the butter and roll each marked corner of the dough into a flap. (The dough will be slightly elastic.) Moisten these flaps lightly with water and replace the butter on the dough. Wrap it securely by stretching the flaps just so they overlap slightly, Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for no longer than 30 miutes. Turn the dough. Place the dough seam side up on a well-floured surface. Keeping it lightly floured, gently roll the dough package into a long rectangle 7 inches by 16 inches. Brush off all the flour form the surface of dough and give it a business letter turn. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 40 minutes before the next turn. (Mark the number of turns on a slip of paper, as the fingertip impressions in the dough used for puff pastry would disappear in this yeast dough as it rises. For each turn, clean the work surface and reflour it. Position the dough so that the closed side is facing to your left, and press down on the edges of the dough with the rolling pin to help keep them straight. (The upper part tends to roll out ore than the bottom part.) Roll and fold the dough a second time exactly the same way, but this time turn it over occasionally to keep the seams and edges even. Be sure to roll into all four corners of the dough, and use a pastry scraper to even the edges. Do a total of 4 turns, resting the dough for 40 minutes between each. Dont worry if the butter breaks through. Just cover the exposed butter layer with flour and keep going. This dough contains so much more butter than a pie dough that a little extra flour wont make much difference to the texture. After the last turn, refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours before rolling it. Shape the croissants. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Roll the dough on a floured counter to a rectangle about 14 inches by 24 inches. Brush off all the flour. Fold the dough over lengthwise so that it is about 6 inches by 22 inches. Using a pizza wheel or sharp knife, trim one short side on an angle (reserve the scraps), cutting through the two layers, then make another diagonal cut to make a triangular piece of dough with a 5-inch base. Continue making diagonal cuts to form triangles down the entire length of the dough. Make a 1/2 -inch notch in the center of the base of each triangle. Open up the two layers of each triangle and cut in half to form 2 triangles. Shape the croissants one at a time, keeping the rest of the triangles covered with plastic wrap. Use the scraps to make 12 to 14 balls (depending on the number of triangles) the size of green grapes (about 4 grams each). Scissors work best to cut the dough for the balls. Keep these covered with plastic wrap too. To shape the croissants, gently stretch each triangle to about 9 inches long: first pull the base sidewaysgently but firmlythen, holding the base in your left hand, use your thumb and two fingers of your right hand to work down the length of the dough, elongating it. Place the triangle on the counter with the narrow point toward you. Shape one of the little balls of dough into a 1 1/4 -inch-long football, and place it at the base of the triangle. Roll the base over the football to encase it by about 1/2 inch. Continue rolling with the fingers of your left hand, keeping the triangle stretched with you right hand. Place the croissant on the lined half sheet pan, with the point underneath. Curve in the sides so that they turn in on the side of the croissant opposite the point. Keep the croissants covered with plastic wrap while you shapes the others. Set 6 to 7 croissants evenly spaced on each pan, so there will be room for them to expand to the baked size of 5 inches by 2 1/2 -inches. Glaze the croissants and let them rise. Lightly beat together the egg and water for the glaze. Brush the croissants with the glaze. Cover and refrigerate the remaining glaze. If you have two large plastic containers or 2-inch-deep 18-inch sheet pans, invert them over the croissants. Alternatively, cover them lightly with very well-oiled plastic. Let rise (ideally at 75F to 85F) until the croissants double in size and are very light in texture, about 2 hours. (At 70F, they can take as long as 3 to 4 hours to rise.) Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 450F 1 hour before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lower level. Glaze and bake the croissants. Gently brush the croissants again with the egg glaze, being careful to use a light touch so as not to deflate them. Place the croissants in the oven and turn the oven down to 400F. Bake for 10 minutes. Reverse the position of the two sheets, turning them around as you do so, and continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the croissants are golden brown (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 210F). The texture will be slightly doughy inside, but on cooling they will continue to cook through perfectly. Cool the croissants. Remove the croissants from the oven and transfer them to racks to cool for 20 to 30 minutes. They are best eaten warm (when the outside is crisp and light, the center soft and tender) or within 3 hours after baking. To Make 12 Pains au Chocolat: Shape the pains au chocolat. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to sit for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, with a sharp knife, cut the chocolate into coarse chunks. Roll the dough on a floured counter to a rectangle 6 inches by 24 inches. Using a pizza wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough lengthwise in half. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 4-inch pieces. You will now have twelve 4-by-3-inch rectangles of dough. Brush off all the flour from the dough. Shaping the pains one at a time, keeping the rest of the dough covered with plastic wrap, set a row of the little chunks of chocolate on each piece of dough close to a longer edge of the dough and, starting from that long side, roll up the dough so that it encloses the chocolate. Moisten the end of the dough with a bit of water, and place the pain seam side down on the lined baking sheets. Space the pains at least 2 inches apart. Glaze the pains au chocolat and let them rise. Lightly beat together the egg and water for the glaze. Brush the pains au chocolat with the egg glaze. Cover and refrigerate the remaining glaze. If you have large plastic containers or 2-inch-deep by 18-inch sheet pans, invert them over the pains. Alternatively, cover them lightly with very well-oiled plastic. Let rise (ideally at 75F to 85F) until the pains au chocolat double in size and are very light in texture, about 2 hours. (At 70F, they can take as long as 3 to 4 hours to rise.) Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 450F 1 hour before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lower level. Glaze and bake the pains au chocolat. Gently brush the pains au chocolat again with the egg glaze, being careful to use a light touch so as not to deflate them. Place the pains au chocolat in the oven and turn the oven down to 400F. Bake for 10 minutes. Reverse the position of the two sheets, turning them around as you do so, and continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pains are golden brown (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 210F). The texture will be slightly doughy inside, but on cooling they will continue to cook through perfectly. Cool the pains au chocolat. Remove the pains au chocolat from the oven and transfer them to racks to cool for 20 to 30 minutes. They are best eaten warm (when the outside is crisp and light, the center soft and tender) or within 3 hours after baking."

"Recipe Name: Shells Potato Soup With Carrots. Ingredients: 5 large potatoes, 1 bunch carrot (or one large pack of baby carrots), 1 large onion, 1 bunch celery (you will only use half), 1 (8 ounce) package bacon, 1 cup diced tomato (1 can diced tomatoes will work), 5 bouillon cubes (or cans of broth to equal about 1 quart), 1 tablespoon basil (or oregano as a substitute), 13 cup flour, 12 cup milk (or 1/4 cup cream), 12 cup butter (or Margarine), 4 bay leaves, 1 tablespoon salt, Instructions: I like to jot down the cookware and supplies youll need in advance, so that youll have what you need at the ready. Cookware & other supplies:. The largest frying pan or skillet that youve got with high sides. 1 quart saucepan. A really large stewpot with a lid. Large mixing bowl (youre going to throw most of your veggies into this bowl once they are prepped). smaller mixing bowl (veggies for the roux will go into this bowl, after prep). cutting board. 1/3 cup measuring cup 1/4 cup measuring cup and a 1/2 cup measuring cup. a \\""dipper\\"" of some kind (will be used to dip out the stock with and pour it into your roux gradually, I use an old metal punch bowl dipper). potato peeler. cheese grater (will be used to grate potato). your favorite chopping knife. my favorite spatula, I call it the \\""spatula of wonder\\"". your favorite tablespoon (my children swiped mine from my ex-husband somehow and its the best spoon Ive every had. You know, it has a nice heavy feel and its all curvy and smooth. Dont get me started. I call it the \\""spoon of wonder\\"". Hes never gonna see that spoon again). Before you start, fill your 1/4 cup measuring cup with water and pour into your dipper - notice what 1/4 cup of something looks like in your dipper. Do the same with 1/2 your measuring cup. Youll need this information for later. Prep work:. -Fry the bacon in a crispy style, dry/blot excess grease and put to the side. -If using whole large carrots, rather than bagged baby carrots, using the potato peeler, peel the carrots and then trim off the tops and tips. Wash thoroughly. Slice them into pieces 1 inch in diameter. For the bagged baby carrots, slice them in two, if they are more than one inch long (unless they are super skinny) - you want them to be bite sized, allowing for some to cook away. When youre done, put them into the large mixing bowl. -Cut four large stalks of celery out of the bunch and also slice the soft, light green celery foliage out of the center of the stalk. Place the soft inner leaves to the side along with any of the very small inner celery stalks that you may have found. Peel the four celery stalks with the potato peeler, careful to peel the edges of the pieces as well (totally necessary to prevent celery \\""strings\\"" from making it into the soup). Slice off the rough tips and discard. Wash thoroughly. Dice into thin slices, 1/8 inch thick or less if you can accomplish it without hurting yourself (this will make celery almost undetectable in the soup, except for the flavor, which is good for those who say oooh, we dont like celery). Take half and put into the large mixing bowl with the carrots. Put the other half into the smaller mixing bowl for the roux. Wash the baby stalks from the heart of the celery, along with the inner leaves and dice in medium sized pieces (1/4 inch or so). Place all of this into the smaller mixing bowl for the roux. Peel the potatoes. Wash thoroughly. Cut one of the potatoes in half and use the cheese grater to grate that half - put the grated potato into the smaller mixing bowl for the roux. With the rest of that potato and the others, slice them into pieces that are between 1 and 2 inches thick, allowing for potato to cook away and still have bite sized pieces. Potato cooks away faster than carrots and so the pieces need to be larger than the cutup carrots. Put the potatoes into the large mixing bowl. Peel the onion and wash it thoroughly. Cut it in half, dicing one half into small pieces - put this half into the smaller mixing bowl for the roux. Slice the other half into pieces that are 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter (country style pieces) and put into the large mixing bowl. Open your can of diced tomatoes up. If youre using fresh tomatoes, finely dice them and put them in a separate bowl to the side for part of the roux. Prepare the stock needed for the roux. If youre using canned stock, go ahead and open up the cans and pour into the sauce pan and simmer to get warm. If youre using bouillon cubes, use five cubes and fill the sauce pan with water two inches from the top and simmer until the cubes are dissolved. Now your prep work is done and its time to begin the roux. A roux is essential to almost any dish that has a significant amount of sauce or juice. Its certainly key to making a good soup, because a roux helps you build flavors that are rich and complex. If at anytime you make more roux than you think you need, you can always freeze it to give you a head start on your cooking in the future. I wouldnt keep it in the freezer longer than a month, but thats probably just me. Some people use olive oil exclusively to begin their roux and I say only use it if you think the \\""nutty\\"" flavor of olive oil will compliment your dish. To me, it doesnt go with just anything. Butter or margarine works nicely for soup and thats what I use. This section might seem too detailed, especially for those experienced in making roux. Its an important cooking skill though and for that reason, Im going to go on perhaps more than most would. The keys to a good roux is to 1) be ready with your ingredients closeby, 2) know when to act and 3) not rush the process. Your roux station should look like this:. -Large Frying Pan on the right front burner. -Quart Saucepan filled with warm Stock on the left front burner. -1/3 cup flour beside the stove on the right-hand side. -cubed stick of butter or margarine beside the flour on the right side. -\\""dipper\\"" to the left of the stove near to the saucepan. -\\""spatula of wonder\\"" near Frying Pan to the right of the stove. -small mixing bowl of roux ingredients to the right of the stove. -can of dices tomatoes or bowl or diced tomatoes to the right of the stove. -chopped basil or oregano to the right of the stove. -salt to the right of the stove. -\\""spoon of wonder\\"" to the right of the stove. Begin the soup - make the roux:. Chop up the stick of butter and put it into the frying pan on medium heat. When it has melted, pour everything in the small mixing bowl into the pan - should be diced onion, diced celery, celery leaves and grated potato. Using your spatula, mix it well with the butter and turn the heat down on the stove to low-medium. Pour in a half tablespoon of salt (or what fits in the crook of your palm when you cup your hand), one tablespoon of basil (or oregano, if youre using that) and stir it all around. Get yourself a stool and get ready to love on your cooking for a while. Stir the mixture frequently, making sure nothing burns. What you want is to see a light caramelization. Once you see that occur, pour your 1/3 cup of flour into the pan and mix quickly and thoroughly with the vegetables. At this point, the mixture should be kind of sticky in the pan. At this point you will love on your cooking at a more alert pace. A few words of advice: as you pour liquid into the pan and stir, you should always pour it gradually out of your dipper as you are stirring - in other words, dont just dump it out into the pan and then stir. And as you stir, be sure to scrap away anything that may be on the sides or on the bottom and occasionally, smash your spatula around to make sure you keep an even consistency. Enough of that, its time to add stock, quickly now! Using your \\""dipper\\"", dip an equivalent to 1/4 cup of stock out and mix quickly and thoroughly into your vegetable/flour mix. In the beginning, as you add liquid, you will notice that the juice is sucked up rather quickly. Add 1/4 cup of stock again and stir. Dont get nervous, just be sure that you always thoroughly mix the liquid into the solids before you add more stock. Adding the liquid slowly in 1/4 cup intervals so that it is mixed with the flour evenly, will prevent clumps. The key to this is to keep everything moving and to add liquid at as soon as it is absorbed. After adding a total of two cups of liquid, add in the diced tomato, continuously stirring. At this point, you should notice that the flour seems to have absorbed its quota of liquid and the mixture will be a gravy like consistency of thickness. Turn the heat down to low, continuously stir and let these flavors concentrate together for 3-5 minutes. At this point, if you were making a gravy or wanted to freeze the roux, you could take it off the stove. But for our soup, were not done yet. At this point, you will begin to add stock at the equivalent of 1/2 cup at a time. It should be creamy with no clumps at all. After adding another cup or so of broth, you will transfer the mixture to your large stew pot. Take the frying pan off of the stove and carefully pour the mixture into the stewpot, using your spatula to scoop out any leavings into the pot. Put the stewpot on the right front burner where the frying pan was and turn the fire up to low-medium. Set the frying pan to the side so that you will have it to hit anyone upside the head that thinks its a good idea to break your concentration just yet. Ha! Gradually add the rest of the stock to the stewpot at 1/2 cup intervals, continuously stirring. Once all of your stock has been added, take the large mixing bowl of vegetables and add to the pot. Add them in slowly so that you dont splash hot soup on yourself! At this point you will add another half tablespoon salt to the soup and put your four bayleaves into the pot. Ensure that broth covers all of the vegetables by at least one inch. If more fluid is needed, gently add the broth to the pot at this time, stirring carefully. Turn the fire up to medium as you stir periodically and then to a soft boil. Once the soup begins to boil, cover and simmer now for an hour or a little longer if you like. Stir periodically and check veggies for tenderness towards the end. Add salt to taste. Different stock varieties will have different amounts of salt and so its best to leave the rest of the salting to personal taste. Whew! What to do now? You can breakup the bacon into pieces and add it to the soup now, add it towards the end or serve it on the side for folks to crumble in their own soup. The other thing you should probably do now, is cleanup the dishes! The last five minutes of cooktime, add 1/2 cup milk or 1/4 cup cream, mix thoroughly, cover and turn off the stove. Allow it to sit there on the stove until its ready to be served. Get your soup bowls out, your crackers or your bread. This is going to be worth the hard work!"
