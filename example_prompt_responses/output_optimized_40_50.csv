"Recipe Name: Sizzling Crepes. Ingredients: 1 cup raw jasmine or regular long-grain rice, 2 tablespoons firmly packed leftover cooked rice, 1 tablespoon firmly packed Ground Steamed Mung Bean (page 322), 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, 1/4 cup coconut milk, canned or freshly made (page 318), 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons water, 1 scallion, white and green parts, thinly sliced, 3/4 pound ground pork or thinly sliced boneless pork shoulder, 1/2 pound small white shrimp in their shells (page 273), legs and tails trimmed, 1 can (15 ounces) whole or broken straw mushrooms, drained and cut lengthwise if whole, 1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced (3/4 cup), 1 cup Ground Steamed Mung Bean (page 322), 4 cups bean sprouts (about 2/3 pound), 1/2 cup canola or other neutral oil, Vegetable Garnish Plate (page 313), preferably with the addition of red perilla, 1 1/2 cups Basic Dipping Sauce made with garlic (page 308), Instructions: To make the batter, put the raw rice in a bowl and add water to cover by 1 inch. Let soak for 3 to 4 hours. Drain the rice and transfer to a blender. Add the cooked rice, mung bean, salt, turmeric, coconut milk, and water. Blend for about 3 minutes, or until very smooth and lemony yellow. Pour the batter through a fine-mesh sieve positioned over a bowl and discard the solids. Stir in the scallion and set the batter aside for 1 hour. It will thicken to the consistency of heavy cream. There should be about 3 cups batter. To make the filling, roughly divide the pork, shrimp, mushrooms, and onion into 8 portions. (Dividing the ingredients now will ensure less frantic frying and avoid overstuffing.) Put these ingredients along with the mung bean, bean sprouts, batter, and oil next to the stove. For each crepe, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add a portion each of the pork, shrimp, mushrooms, and onion and saute, breaking up the meat, for about 45 seconds, or until seared and aromatic. Visualize a line down the middle of the skillet and roughly arrange the ingredients on either side of the line. Anything in the middle would make it hard to fold the crepe neatly later. Because the rice will have settled at the bottom of the bowl, give the batter a good stir with a ladle. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into the skillet and swirl the skillet to cover the bottom; a bit going up the side forms a lovely lacy edge. The batter should dramatically sizzle (making that xeo noise!) and bubble. When it settles down, sprinkle on 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mung bean, and then pile 1/2 cup of the bean sprouts on one side. Lower the heat to medium, cover, and cook until the bean sprouts have wilted slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove the lid and drizzle in 1 teaspoon of the oil around the rim of the pan. Lower the heat slightly and continue to cook, uncovered, for 3 to 4 minutes to crisp the crepe. The edge will have pulled away from the skillet and turned golden brown. At this point, use a spatula to check underneath for a crispy bottom. From the center to the edge, the crepe should go from being soft to crispy. Lower the heat if you need to cook it longer. When you are satisfied, use a spatula to fold the half without the bean sprouts over the other half. Use the spatula to transfer the crepe to a serving dish, or simply slide it out of the pan onto the dish. Increase the heat to medium-high and repeat with the remaining batter and filling ingredients to make 8 crepes in all. Use any left over batter to make a poor mans crepe without filling. When you are comfortable with the technique, you can try frying the crepes in 2 skillets at the same time. These crepes taste best straight from the skillet, so have diners at the ready. Serve the crepes with the vegetable garnish plate and dipping sauce. Pass around 1 or 2 pairs of kitchen scissors for diners to cut their crepes into manageably sized pieces. To eat, tear a piece of lettuce roughly the size of your palm, place a piece of the crepe on it, add cucumber slices and a few herb leaves, shape into a bundle, and dunk into the dipping sauce. To prepare a shortcut rice flour batter, in a bowl, stir together 2 cups rice flour, 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric. Make a well in the center, pour in 1/3 cup coconut milk and 2 cups water, and whisk to create a silky batter. Add 1 scallion (white and green parts), thinly sliced, and set aside for 1 hour. Cook this batter in the same way. For these crepes and the ones on page 277, buy a pork shoulder steak, debone it, and slice the meat. You do not need to invest in a whole roast.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Jota - Bean and Pork Soup. Ingredients: 1/2 pound dried borlotti beans, pinto or red kidney beans, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 11/4 cups minced yellow onions, 2 teaspoons minced garlic, 4 small smoked pork chops, or 8 ounces other smoked pork, such as smoked ham hock or smoked ham cut into 1-inch cubes, 1 bay leaf, plus 1, 6 to 8 cups water, 4 ounces pancetta, chopped, 1/2 pound sauerkraut, rinsed and drained, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 teaspoon whole peppercorns, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 4 ounces prosciutto di San Daniele, finely diced, Polenta croutons, recipe below, Extra-virgin olive oil, topping, Instructions: Place the beans in a large bowl. Cover with cold water by 2 inches and soak overnight. Drain. In a large pot, heat the oil. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and 1 bay leaf and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the pork chops and cook, turning, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the beans and enough water to cover (6 to 7 cups) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour. With a heavy wooden spoon or potato masher, mash about half of the beans against the sides of the pot. Continue cooking until very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, cook the pancetta over medium heat until the fat is rendered, about 6 minutes. Add the sauerkraut, 1 cup of water, the remaining bay leaf, the sugar, peppercorns, and salt. Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender and aromatic, about 30 minutes. Add the sauerkraut mixture to the beans and stir well to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and discard the bay leaves. Ladle into 4 deep bowls, giving each person 1 pork chop. Place several fried croutons in each bowl and top with the diced prosciutto. Grind freshly ground black pepper over the top and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Serve. 3 cups water 1 cup polenta 2 teaspoons salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup olive oil In a heavy medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil over high heat. Stir the polenta and salt into the water, lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring from time to time. Cook until the polenta is cooked through and thickens, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter until smooth. Pour the polenta onto a lightly oiled, baking sheet and spread to about 3/4-inch thick. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day in advance. Run a knife around the edge of the baking sheet and unmold the polenta onto a cutting board. Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares and refrigerate, wrapped, until ready to cook. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat. Add the polenta squares in batches and cook quickly until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining polenta, adding more oil as needed. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Black Forest Cheesecake. Ingredients: 12 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 12 cup butter, 1 teaspoon water, 12 teaspoon instant coffee granules, 1 cup graham cracker crumbs, 13 cup brown sugar, firmly packed, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened, 1 14 cups sugar, granulated, 5 large eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 12 cup semisweet chocolate morsel, 1 teaspoon water, 1 teaspoon instant coffee granules, 1 (16 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, divided, juice reserved, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, cherry juice, reserved from maraschinos, 3 tablespoons semisweet chocolate morsels, Instructions: Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Set a roasting pan half full of water on the lower rack. Grease a 10-inch spring-form pan. For Crust:. Melt chocolate morsels and butter in medium, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on high for 1 minute. Morsels may retain some of their shape. If necessary, microwave at additional 10 to 15 second intervals until melted. Combine water and coffee granules in a very small bowl and stir to dissolve. Add coffee, graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar and cinnamon to chocolate mixture and mix well. Press in bottom of the spring-form pan and 1 inch up the side of the pan. For Filling:. Beat cream cheese in a large mixer bowl until light and fluffy. Add sugar, mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, beat well after each addition. Amy says not to over-beat the filling after adding the eggs. Stir in vanilla extract. Reserve 1/3 cup batter. Pour remaining batter into prepared crust. Melt morsels in uncovered microwave-safe bowl on high power for 1 minute, stir if necessary, microwave at additional 10 to 15 second intervals until melted. Combine water and coffee granules in a very small bowl and stir to dissolve. Combine melted chocolate, reserved 1/3 cup cream cheese mixture and coffee. Stir until smooth using wire whisk. Spread mixture on top of batter. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup finely chopped cherries. Gently swirl with a thin knife. Place cheesecake on baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 200 degrees and bake for 1 hour or until knife inserted in center comes out with a creamy coating. Turn off oven and let cake cool in oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove cake from oven. Cool on wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or overnight. For topping:. Combine cornstarch and reserved cherry juice in small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thickened. Cool completely. Stir in remaining cherries. Remove side of spring-form pan. Cover top of cheesecake with cherry topping. Place morsels in small, heavy-duty plastic bag. Microwave on high power for 30 seconds: knead. Microwave at additional 10 to 15 second intervals, kneading until smooth. Cut small hole in corner of bag. Squeeze to drizzle over cherry topping.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Garden Halibut. Ingredients: 2 Tablespoons Butter, 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil, 1/2 whole Purple Onion Or Two Med. Shallots, 2 cloves Garlic, Minced, 1/4 cups White Wine, 1 whole Lemon, 1 Tablespoon Fresh Dill, Chopped, 1/2 whole Yellow Or Orange Pepper, 1/2 pints Cherry Tomatoes, 1/2 cups Grated Or Cubed Zucchini, 1 Tablespoon Capers, 2 Tablespoons Fresh Basil, 4 pieces Halibut, Cod, Or Other White Fish, Instructions: You can prepare this recipe using the ingredients listed or substitute your favorite veggies instead. It always turns out tasty. Add one tablespoon of the butter and oil to medium skillet on medium high heat. Add chopped onion. Saute until they begin to become translucent. Lower heat and add garlic. Cook an additional minute. Add white wine. Lightly zest one small lemon into the sauce and then add the juice of the whole lemon. Add dill. At this point I cut up the pepper, tomatoes, and zucchini and add them to the sauce, keeping the heat about medium low. The sauce should be reducing slightly. Taste the sauce and decide if you need to add more wine, salt & pepper or even a little water. It all depends on your preference. Let the sauce continue to reduce a bit. Again, this all depends on how juicy your tomatoes and lemon are. You may need to play around with it a bit, but I dont think you can mess it up. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter. It makes the sauce nice and glossy and mellows everything out a bit. Butter makes everything better! Remove from heat and add drained capers and fresh basil. Make sure your fish is nice and dry before salting and peppering it. Set aside. Cut out and fold four parchment or foil pouches large enough for each piece of fish. Place a tablespoon or so of sauce in the middle of each before placing the fish down. Spoon remaining sauce evenly over each piece of fish. Securely fold your pouches closed. There are several websites with tutorials on how to fold a parchment or foil pouch if youre not sure how. At this point you can either bake or grill the fish. If youre grilling them, place them on a medium hot grill for about fifteen minutes depending on the thickness of your fillets. The fish will flake apart when done. If you bake the fish, first place the pouches on a baking sheet. Place in a preheated 350 degree oven for around twenty to twenty-five minutes, again depending on the thickness of your fish. I prefer to use the foil pouches when grilling and parchment pouches when Im baking the fish in the oven. The foil just seems sturdier on the grill to me. One way to serve this is to remove the fish from the pouch and place on a nice bed of white or Jasmine rice and pour the sauce and veggies over the top. Please dont judge the photo of the halibut I took too harshly. It really is a beautiful dish in reality. I have a humble point and shoot camera, it was dusk and the light was fading, and I am NOT a food stylist. Enough said!","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Yalanci Sarma. Ingredients: 1/4 cups Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 whole Medium Yellow Onion, Diced, 13 cups Long Grain White Rice, 4 Tablespoons Tomato Paste, 2 Tablespoons Water, 1/4 cups Cherry Tomatoes, 1/4 cups Pine Nuts, Crushed (optional), 1/4 cups Fresh Basil, Chopped, 1/4 cups Fresh Dill, Chopped, 1/4 cups Fresh Parsley, Chopped, 1/4 cups Fresh Mint, Chopped, 1 teaspoon Ground Allspice, 1 teaspoon Cayenne, 1 teaspoon Paprika, 15 whole Grape Leaves, Rinsed And Blanched, 1/2 cups Fresh Lemon Juice, 2 cups Water, Instructions: For the filling: 1. Heat the olive oil over medium high heat and add the onions. 2. As the onions start to sweat and become translucent (roughly 35 minutes), add the rice and remaining ingredients, including any of the listed herbs and spices youd like to include. Stir frequently. 3. Cook all ingredients together on medium high heat for 57 minutes before reducing heat to a simmer. 4. Let the ingredients simmer for another 10 minutes or so. The goal here is to lightly cook the ingredients but leave the rice slightly uncooked (it will cook more later). For the grape leaves: 1. As the filling mixture simmers, bring a pot of water to a boil. With the water boiling, add grape leaves and boil for 23 minutes. 2. After 23 minutes, take out grape leaves and drain. Cut off any remaining stems while the leaves are still soft. 3. Lay a grape leaf on a flat surface with the shiny side up (or the veiny side of the leaf facing down). 4. Place 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons filling in the center of the leaf and shape into a small cylinder. 5. Fold the bottom part of the leaf over the filling and tuck underneath on the other side, enclosing the filling. 6. Roll the filling up the leaf at 1 or 2 more times, depending on the size of the leaf, to wrap it further in the leaf. 7. Fold the left side of the leaf into the center and the right side of the leaf into the center, fully enclosing the filling in the leaf on all sides. 8. Fold the rest of the leaf into a point and roll all the way until all the leaf has been fully rolled. 9. Fill a small pot with the finished grape leaves, tightly packed together, creating multiple layers stacked on top of one another. If you have leftover or unusable grape leaves, use them at the bottom of the pot to act as a buffer between the grape leaves and the heat. 10. Mix lemon juice with enough water to submerge the grape leaves and place a small weight (heavy plate or dish) on top of the grape leaves so theyll stay in place. Please note that this weight should be able to take the upcoming heat from the boiling liquid. 11. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and let simmer for 1 hour. 12. After 1 hour, remove cover and weight from the pot and remove grape leaves from water. Most of it should have been absorbed by now, but there might be a little remaining at the bottom. 13. Take the pot off the heat and serve the leaves. Recipe adapted from The Armenian Kitchen.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Multipurpose Meat Paste. Ingredients: 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 2 tablespoons tapioca starch, 1 tablespoon sugar, 5 tablespoons fish sauce, 3 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil, Instructions: Slice each breast and thigh across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick strips. When cutting the breast tenders, remove and discard the silvery strip of tendon. Keep any visible fat for richness, but trim away any cartilage or sinewy bits, as they wont grind well. To make the marinade, in a bowl large enough to fit the chicken, whisk together the baking powder, tapioca starch, sugar, fish sauce, and oil. Add the chicken and use a rubber spatula to mix well. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight. The chicken will stiffen as it sits. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and use a spoon to break it apart. Working in batches, grind the chicken in a food processor until a smooth, stiff, light pink paste forms. (This step takes several minutes and the machine will get a good workout.) Stop the machine occasionally to scrape down the sides. When you are finished, there should be no visible bits of chicken and the paste should have a slight sheen. Using the rubber spatula, transfer each batch to another bowl, taking care to clean well under the blade. The paste is ready to use, or it can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days. For long-term keeping, divide it into 1/2- and 1-pound portions (a scant 1 cup paste weighs 1/2 pound), wrap in a double layer of plastic wrap, and freeze for up to 2 months. To make gio the old-fashioned way, you must first hand pound the meat and then add the marinade ingredients. Use a large Thai stone mortar and pestle, which can be found reasonably priced at Asian restaurant-supply and housewares shops. My 9-inch-wide mortar has a 5-cup capacity bowl that is 6 1/2 inches wide and 4 inches deep. The 8-inch-long pestle is about 2 inches wide at the base. Select a pestle that fits your hand comfortably. (Stone pestles, heavier than the wooden one mentioned in the chapter introduction, make pounding easier.) To minimize physical strain, I sit on a low kitchen stool and put the mortar on a solid table or box, with the rim of the mortar slightly below my knee. You may also sit on the floor with the mortar between your legs. Place a thick towel under the mortar to protect the work surface. Regardless of your setup, you want to sit astride the mortar and efficiently use your upper body strength to work the pestle. It takes about 35 minutes to produce a full batch of paste, so you may want to halve the recipe. To yield gio that is close to the traditional version, pound pork (see Note, above), which works better than chicken. The beef mixture used for making Beef, Dill, and Peppercorn Sausage (page 161) is also a good candidate for hand pounding. Cut the meat into 1/4-inch-thick strips as instructed in the recipe. Blot the meat dry with paper towels to prevent it from sliding around the mortar. In a small bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients. Set aside near the pounding station. (Hand-pounded gio doesnt traditionally call for leavener and starch, but I find that they guarantee a silkier result that is neither too dense nor too firm.) Put about 1/2 pound of the meat (or a quantity you find manageable) in the mortar and start pounding with a steady rhythm, pausing only to remove any gristly bits that come loose. After about 4 minutes, the meat should have gathered into a mass and, perhaps, even stuck to the pestle, allowing you to use the pestle to lift the meat from the mortar and pound it down again. Keep pounding for another 2 minutes to make the meat cohere into a smooth mass that resembles a ball of dough. Use a rubber spatula or plastic dough scraper to transfer the meat to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining meat. Add all the marinade ingredients to the meat, stirring with a fork until the marinade is no longer visible. In batches, pound the meat for about 3 minutes longer to combine all the ingredients well. You should hear a suction noise as air is mixed in. The finished paste will feel firm and look ragged, and small nuggets of meat will be suspended in the paste. Transfer the paste to a clean bowl and repeat with the remaining meat.","```cypher
