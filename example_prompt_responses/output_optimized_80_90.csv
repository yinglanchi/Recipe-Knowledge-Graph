"Recipe Name: Individual Lasagna Gratins. Ingredients: 1 cup Packed Fresh Spinach, 1 cup Flour, 2 whole Eggs, Room Temperature, 4 whole Leeks, 6 ounces, weight Pancetta (or Bacon), 1 pinch Large Pinch Of Coarse Salt, 1 pinch Large Pinch Of Freshly Ground Pepper, 2 cloves Garlic, Minced Or Grated, 3 Tablespoons Finely Chopped Fresh Parsley, 4 Tablespoons Butter, 4 Tablespoons Flour, 1 cube Chicken Bouillon, 2 cups Milk (whole Or Lowfat), 1 pinch Salt, Kosher, 18 teaspoons White Pepper, 1/4 teaspoons Ground Nutmeg, 1 cup Grated Parmigiano Reggiano Or Grana Padano Cheese, 1 Tablespoon Dried Oregano, Instructions: Make the pasta dough: (Skip this step if using store bought lasagna noodles just cook your noodles). Steam the spinach til just wilted. Cool and squeeze out excess water by wrapping it in paper towels. Then chop finely and set aside. In a bowl or on the counter, mound the flour and make a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well and, using a fork, blend the eggs. Add the chopped spinach to the eggs and beat with the fork. Slowly begin to incorporate the flour. If you are using part semolina flour, you may want to add a couple of teaspoons of water to make the dough easier to work with. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead, adding more flour if needed. Incorporate enough flour to make a nice soft dough that doesnt stick to your hands, but is still moist. This may take more flour than one cup (it depends on the quality of your eggs, how moist your spinach is, etc.). I used more than one cup of flour. Wrap dough in floured plastic and let rest on counter for about 30 minutes. Make the filling: Trim root ends off of leeks and trim off dark green leaves. Leave some of the lighter green part of the leeks. Slice leeks in half, vertically. Wash if there is dirt inside. Slice leeks one more time, vertically, to make quarters. Then slice horizontally and make sure the slices are very thin. In a large saute pan, cook pancetta until slightly crisp. Add leeks, salt and pepper and saute gently for about 5 minutes, until leeks are soft but not brown. Add garlic and saute for one minute. Remove from heat and add chopped parsley. Transfer to a bowl and let cool. Make the bechamel sauce: In a medium heavy pot, melt the butter. Add the flour and with a whisk, stir the mixture for a couple of minutes, letting the flour cook but not burn. Add the chicken bouillon cube and whisk. Slowly add the milk and stir with the whisk. Keep adding some milk, whisk, and add more milk until all the milk has been used. Add the salt and pepper and ground nutmeg and cook for a few minutes, gently, until bechamel is thick. Transfer to a heat proof bowl and allow to cool, stirring every once in a while. Make the pasta sheets: Bring a large pot of well salted water to a simmer. Divide dough into 4 pieces. (You want to end up with three foot-long pasta sheets for each gratin dish.) With pasta rollers, roll out dough starting at widest setting, #1. Dust dough with flour to prevent sticking, fold in half and insert into widest setting again. Repeat a few times. The dough will be very soft now. Adjust rollers to #2 and insert dough again. Do not fold this time. Dust with dough if pasta is sticky and keep adjusting rollers until you get to setting #5. After dough goes through setting #5, measure pasta sheet. It should measure at least 30 inches. If it doesnt, insert into #5 again and hold pasta a little taught, letting it stretch as it goes through rollers. You should have a 30 inch sheet of pasta. Cut into three 10-inch pieces. (When pasta sheets cook, they will end up being about a foot long). Set on clean counter. Repeat with remaining 3 pieces of dough. Place a colander or strainer into a medium size heat proof bowl. Place next to stove. Have a handled strainer or spider ready. Lay a clean towel on counter. Have 3 more clean towels ready. Bring the pot of water up to a boil. Lower three sheets of pasta slowly into the water. Boil gently for 60 seconds. With the strainer, gently lift all three sheets and place into the colander. Take bowl to sink and add cold water, gently swishing the pasta sheets with your hand. Let pasta sit in cold water for a few seconds and then lift the colander out and dump out the water. Pasta sheets should be cool enough to handle now. Lay them gently, spreading them out, onto the clean towel. Repeat this process three more times, with remaining 3 sets of pasta noodles. Lay another clean towel right on top of the first layer of pasta noodles and and lay the next set of pasta noodles right on top. Repeat until all the pasta is cooked. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Assemble lasagnas: Spray 4 small gratin dishes with nonstick cooking spray. Lay one pasta sheet in each dish, allowing half to drape over. Place a spoonful of bechamel sauce on each pasta sheet and spread with a spatula. Sprinkle a small amount of the pancetta leek topping over bechamel. Grate some cheese on top. Fold pasta sheet over the filling to create another layer of pasta. You may have to fold the sheet again this is okay. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets and filling until you have made three layers of filling in each gratin dish. Fold remaining pasta sheet over the top of each dish and spread the remainder of the bechamel sauce on top. Grate some cheese on top of each gratin and sprinkle with some oregano. Place dishes on a baking sheet and cover the whole thing tightly with foil (I use Reynolds Nonstick Foil it works perfectly for lasagna, so the cheese doesnt stick). Bake lasagnas for 45 minutes at 350. Remove foil, raise oven temp to 400 degrees and bake for an additional 10 minutes until tops are just golden brown.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Bagels. Ingredients: 1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast, 4 cups (18 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour, 2 1/2 cups (20 ounces) water, at room temperature, 1/2 teaspoon (.055 ounce) instant yeast, 3 3/4 cups (17 ounces) unbleached high-gluten or bread flour, 2 3/4 teaspoons (.7 ounce) salt, 2 teaspoons (.33 ounce) malt powder or 1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) dark or light malt syrup, honey, or brown sugar, 1 tablespoon baking soda, Cornmeal or semolina flour for dusting, Sesame seeds, poppy seeds, kosher salt, rehydrated dried minced garlic or onions, or chopped fresh onions that have been tossed in oil (optional), Instructions: To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining 3/4 cup flour to stiffen the dough. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flourall the ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should pass the windowpane test (page 58) and register 77 to 81F. If the dough seems too dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems tacky or sticky, add more flour to achieve the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky. Immediately divide the dough into 4 1/2-ounce pieces for standard bagels, or smaller if desired. Form the pieces into rolls, as shown on page 82. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with one of the following shaping methods. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pans. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and slip each pan into a food-grade plastic bag, or cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the float test. Fill a small bowl with cool or room-temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the pot the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil for another minute. If you like very chewy bagels, you can extend the boiling to 2 minutes per side. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you decide to replace the paper, be sure to spray the new paper lightly with spray oil to prevent the bagels from sticking to the surface.) If you want to top the bagels, do so as soon as they come out of the water. You can use any of the suggestions in the ingredients list or a combination. I make a seed and salt blend. When all the bagels have been boiled, place the pans on the 2 middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 5 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are baking only 1 pan, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven setting to 450F and continue baking for about 5 minutes, or until the bagels turn light golden brown. You may bake them darker if you prefer. Remove the pans from the oven and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving. Method 1: Poke a hole in a ball of bagel dough and gently rotate your thumb around the inside of the hole to widen it to approximately 2 1/2 inches in diameter. The dough should be as evenly stretched as possible (try to avoid thick and thin spots). Method 2: Roll out the dough into an 8-inch-long rope. (This may require rolling part of the way and resting if the pieces are too elastic and snap back, in which case, allow them to rest for 3 minutes and then extend them again to bring to full length.) Wrap the dough around the palm and back of your hand, between the thumb and forefinger, overlapping the ends by several inches. Press the overlapping ends on the counter with the palm of your hand, rocking back and forth to seal. Lean, stiff dough; indirect method; commercial yeast Day 1: 2 hours sponge; 10 to 15 minutes mixing; 1 to 1 1/2 fermentation, shaping, and proofing Day 2: 10 minutes boiling; 15 to 20 minutes baking It is possible to make a sourdough version of these bagels by replacing the sponge stage with 5 cups (35 ounces) of wild-yeast barm starter (page 230) and then increasing the instant yeast in the final dough to 1 1/2 teaspoons (.17 ounce). Treat the dough the same as instructed for regular bagels from that point on. The flavor will have the distinctive tang of sourdough bread while retaining the chewy characteristics of a classic bagel. Before making a sourdough version, however, you should first make the version that follows in order to master the technique. For cinnamon raisin bagels, increase the yeast in the final dough to 1 teaspoon, and add 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon and 5 tablespoons of granulated sugar to the final dough. Rinse 2 cups of loosely packed raisins with warm water to wash off surface sugar, acid, and natural wild yeast. Add the raisins during the final 2 minutes of mixing. Proceed as directed, but do not top the bagels with any garnishes. When they come out of the oven and are still hot, you can brush the tops with melted butter and dip them in cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon-sugar crust, if desired.

"Recipe Name: Manly Man Lasagna. Ingredients: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 pound hot Italian sausage, removed from casing, 4 (25-ounce) jars tomato sauce (recommended: Emerils Kicked Up Tomato Sauce), 3 1/2 pounds spinach, stemmed and washed, 2 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup minced shallots, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1 pound portobello mushroom caps, sliced, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, Parmesan Bechamel Sauce, recipe follows, 30 ounces ricotta cheese, 2 cups grated Fontina, 3 cups grated mozzarella, 3 pounds dried lasagna sheets (1-ounce per sheet), 5 cups grated Parmesan, Bolognese Sauce, recipe follows, Instructions: Set a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to the pan and once the oil is hot, crumble the sausage into the pan. Cook the sausage, stirring often until well browned on all sides, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the tomato sauce to the pan and allow the sauce to simmer, for 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spinach and cook for 2 minutes. Drain in a fine mesh strainer, pressing with a large spoon to release as much water as possible. Finely chop and set aside until ready to assemble the lasagna. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and season with the salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender and have given off their liquid, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool. Set aside until ready to assemble the lasagna. In a bowl, combine the 2 cups of the Bechamel sauce, the ricotta, Fontina, and mozzarella cheeses. Set aside until ready to assemble the lasagna. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 15 1/2 by 11 1/2 by 4-inch roasting pan with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Ladle 4 cups of the Italian sausage-tomato sauce into the bottom of the pan. Lay 6 lasagna sheets across the top of the tomato sauce. Spread 1/2 of the spinach and half of the mushrooms over the top of the pasta, and pour 3 cups of the Parmesan Bechamel over the mushrooms and spinach. Sprinkle 1 cup of the Parmesan over the bechamel, as well as 1/2 the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with another layer of 6 lasagna sheets. Place 1/2 of the bolognese over the lasagna and top with another layer of pasta. Pour another 4 cups of the tomato sausage sauce over the pasta, and top with another layer of pasta. Spread the remaining spinach, mushrooms and bechamel over the pasta and sprinkle another cup of Parmesan over top. Top with the remaining ricotta cheese mixture and lay another row of pasta over the cheese mixture. Spread the remaining bolognese sauce over the pasta and top with another row of pasta sheets. Pour the remaining tomato sausage sauce over the pasta. Wrap the top of the roasting pan with aluminum foil and set the roasting pan on a baking sheet. Bake covered for 1 1/2 hours, or until the pasta sheets are cooked through. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and remove and discard the aluminum foil. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the top of the tomato sauce, and return the pan to the oven. Bake until the cheese is well browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow lasagna to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 8 cups milk 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 2 cups grated Parmesan Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, to make a light roux, about 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, slowly add the milk and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until thickened, 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper, nutmeg, and Parmesan and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the bechamel until ready to assemble the lasagna. Yield: about 2 quarts 2 tablespoons butter 12 ounces bacon, diced 8 ounces ham, diced 1 pound ground veal 1 pound ground pork 2 pounds ground beef 3 cups chopped onions 1 cup finely chopped carrots 1 cup finely chopped celery 1 pound thinly sliced button mushrooms 3 tablespoons minced garlic 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 2 cups dry white wine 4 cups chicken stock Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 cup chicken livers, finely chopped 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves In a large Dutch oven, heat the butter over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and ham and cook until caramelized and light brown, about 15 minutes. Add the ground meats and cook over high heat until well browned, stirring constantly, about 20 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and mushrooms and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, cloves and nutmeg to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine and stock and simmer over medium-high heat until sauce is thickened and flavorful, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken livers to the pot and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and parsley, and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Set aside until ready to assemble lasagna. Yield: about 3 quarts","```cypher

"Recipe Name: ""Traditional Boiled Beef with Spinach Puree, Apple Horseradish Sauce, and Baby Vegetables"". Ingredients: 1 large onion, halved crosswise, Fine sea salt, 1 large or 2 small \\""chicken steaks,\\"" from the chuck (about 4 1/2 pounds total), trimmed, 5 veal marrowbones, 6 baby carrots, 4 baby turnips, 4 small kohlrabi (see tips, below), 1 celery root, quartered, 1 tablespoon juniper berries (see tips, below), 1 teaspoon allspice berries, Freshly ground black pepper, 1 bay leaf, preferably fresh, cut in half, 1 sprig fresh thyme, 1 garlic clove, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, 3 shallots, diced, 1 teaspoon fine sea salt, 2 large garlic cloves, minced, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 sprig fresh thyme, 3/4 cup vegetable stock or canned low-sodium vegetable broth, 12 ounces (1 bunch) spinach, stems removed, Freshly ground white pepper, Cayenne pepper, Freshly grated nutmeg, 3 Golden Delicious apples (1 1/2 pounds), Juice of 1 lemon, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 cinnamon stick, about 3 inches, 1 whole clove, 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, or more to taste, 1 cup cubed white bread, crusts removed, 3/4 cup whole milk, 2 extra-large egg yolks, 8 small cornichons, chopped, 1 heaping tablespoon creme fraiche, 1 heaping tablespoon sour cream, 1/4 cup Champagne vinegar, 1 1/2 cups canola oil, Fine sea salt and freshly ground white pepper, 1 hard-cooked egg, finely diced, 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives, Optional Garnish, Freshly grated horseradish, Sliced fresh lovage leaves (see tips, below), Freshly grated nutmeg, Fleur de sel (see Note), Finely chopped fresh chives, Instructions: 1. Heat a heavy saute pan over high heat and add the onion halves, cut side down. Cook until they blacken on their cut sides, about 10 minutes. 2. Fill a stockpot halfway with water and set it over high heat. When the water boils, salt it well, then add the meat, onions, and 2 of the marrowbones. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Partially cover the pot and bring the water to a very low simmer; it should bubble only slightly for the duration of the cooking time. Simmer for 3 hours, checking on the meat periodically, turning it occasionally and adding a little more water if necessary to keep the meat covered. 3. Add the carrots, turnips, kohlrabi, celery root, juniper berries, allspice berries, pepper, and bay leaf. Simmer until the vegetables are cooked, 20 to 30 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the vegetables to a platter as they become tender. Continue to cook the meat until there is no resistance when it is pierced in its center with a long fork yet it still retains its shape, another 30 minutes. 4. Place the remaining 3 marrowbones, marrow sides up, in a saucepan. Cover with cold water, and add the thyme and garlic. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and let the bones poach until the marrow is translucent and soft, about 5 minutes. Drain the bones. Slide a paring knife around the inside of the hole to gently push the marrow free, and cut the marrow into 1/2-inch slices. Reheat the marrow in a 250F oven or at a low setting in a microwave just before serving. 5. Meanwhile, prepare the spinach puree: In a wide saucepan or saute pan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Let it cook until the white milk solids fall to the bottom and turn nut-brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the shallots and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and cook, stirring, until the shallots soften, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 2 more minutes. 6. Add the cream and thyme to the pan and bring the liquid to a boil. Simmer until reduced by one third, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in the vegetable stock and let the liquid return to a boil. Add the spinach and cook gently, stirring and tossing, until it is tender, about 2 minutes. 7. Remove the thyme. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spinach to a blender or food processor, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Puree the spinach, and season it with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and nutmeg to taste. If necessary, add some of the reserved cooking liquid so the puree is just loose enough to pour. Keep warm (or reheat gently before serving). 8. Prepare the apple-horseradish sauce: Peel the apples, reserving the peels and submerging the apples in a bowl of water acidulated with the lemon juice. 9. Place the apple peels in a small saucepan. Cover with 3/4 cup water and add the sugar, cinnamon stick, and clove. Bring to a boil and let simmer, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the peels steep in the liquid until cool. 10. Place the horseradish in a large bowl and grate the apples finely over it. Strain the apple-peel liquid, and pour 1/2 cup of the liquid over the grated apple. Toss to combine. and add more horseradish if desired. Set aside. 11. To prepare the chive mayonnaise, place the bread cubes in a bowl and cover with the milk. Let soak until soft, about 20 minutes. 12. Use your hands to squeeze the milk from the bread cubes, and place them in a blender with the egg yolks, 1/4 cup broth taken from the kavalierspitz, chopped cornichons, creme fraiche, and sour cream. Blend to combine. With the motor running, add a few drops of Champagne vinegar, then drizzle in a small amount of the canola oil in a very thin stream, processing until the oil is absorbed before adding a little more vinegar. Continue alternating vinegar and oil until you have used it all. The mixture should be of a thick but pourable consistency, and just slightly piquant. Season it to taste with salt and white pepper, and set it aside. Just before serving, stir in the hard-cooked egg and chives. 13. When the beef is tender, transfer it to a platter and cover it with plastic wrap. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer. If youre not going to serve it immediately, place the beef in a clean pot, cover with the strained broth, and surround with the baby vegetables. Heat gently just before serving. 14. To serve, slice the steak across the grain into 2-inch-wide pieces. Lay them in the center of each soup plate, and garnish with the baby vegetables. Ladle the cooking liquid on top of and around the meat. Garnish with a slice of bone marrow, and any or all of the garnishes (freshly grated horseradish, lovage, grated nutmeg, a sprinkle of fleur de sel, chopped chives). Serve with the spinach puree, apple horseradish sauce, and chive mayonnaise on the side. \\""To elevate and refine this traditional dish, we paid close attention to every detail, using only the highest-quality ingredients and sophisticated techniques,\\"" says Lohninger. He prefers the Kavalierspitz, a tender cut from the shoulder, over the more common tafelspitz cut from the upper leg. \\""This was Kaiser Franz Josefs favorite cut,\\"" says Lohninger. \\""Because it has gelatin running through the middle, it stays very moist and juicy.\\ Kavalierspitz is sold in the United States as Yankee steak or chicken steak, and youll probably have to call ahead at a good butcher to get it. Beef cheeks or short ribs could also be substituted. \\""The garnishes in this recipe are very authentic,\\"" says Lohninger. \\""But if youre pressed for time, you can substitute unsweetened store bought applesauce mixed with a little horseradish for the applesauce recipe here, and sour cream mixed with chives for the white sauce. But in my opinion, you need the creamed spinach or a cabbage dish to really feel like youre having boiled beef. \\"". Purple-black, pea-sized juniper berries are the flavoring in gin, so youll recognize their piney-sweet flavor. In Austrian cooking they are added to everything from cabbage to meat. Theyre generally available in the spice section of better supermarkets. Look for berries that are still somewhat soft rather than hard and shriveled. Kohlrabi are bulbous, green vegetables, sometimes tinged with purple, that are popular in Austrian cooking for their crisp, nutty, white flesh, similar to a mild turnip. Lovage is a celerylike vegetable. A mix of parsley and celery leaves can be substituted for the lovage leaves.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Sugar-Cookie Easter Bunny House. Ingredients: 4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled, plus more for dusting, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon fine salt, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 3 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature (see Cooks Note), 1 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, Sanding sugar, optional, 2 cups Royal Icing, recipe follows, 1 cup Coconut Grass, recipe follows, Easter candy, such as pastel jelly beans, small foil-wrapped chocolate eggs and bunnies, small peanut butter cups, colored mini-marshmallows, marshmallow chicks, sanding sugar, 2 1/4 cups confectioners sugar, 2 tablespoons meringue powder, 1 cup lightly-packed shredded sweetened coconut, Green food coloring, Instructions: Special equipment: parchment paper, ruler, scissors, rolling pin, pizza cutter, cookie cutters, disposable pastry bags, small and medium decorating tips For the dough: Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Mix the eggs and vanilla with a fork in a small bowl. Beat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed until the butter has picked up the sugars, about 30 seconds. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 2 minutes.) Increase the speed to medium, and beat until slightly creamy, about 1 minute (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer), stopping halfway through to scrape the bowl. Reduce the speed to low, slowly add in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture a heaping cup at a time, in 3 additions, stopping a few times to scrape the bowl and beaters (if using a hand mixer, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning). Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium (higher with a hand mixer), and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 2 minutes (about 5 minutes with a hand mixer). Turn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide the dough into 3 even pieces, each about 13 ounces. Shape each piece into a 6-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight. While the dough chills, cut templates for the house from paper: 1 base, 8 by 8 inches 1 roof, 5 3/4 by 6 1/2 inches 2 slanted side walls, both 5 inches wide, one 4 inches high on the left and 3 inches high on the right, the other 3 inches high on the left and 4 inches high on the right, with optional windows cut out 1 front wall, 5 inches wide by 4 inches high, with a door cut out 1 back wall, 5 by 3 inches To roll, cut and bake the cookies and house: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (have extra parchment on hand). Take 2 of the dough pieces out of the refrigerator, and let them soften until just pliable but still cool and firm, about 15 minutes. Dust a piece of parchment with flour. Dust one square of dough with flour, and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick (no thicker) and 9 to 10 inches square. Lift the dough occasionally to make sure it isnt sticking to the parchment. Cut out cookies with cutters; transfer to a prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Freeze while you cut the rest of the dough. Reserve the scraps for the house pieces. Take the last piece of dough from the refrigerator to soften. Dust the parchment and the second piece of dough with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick and 9 to 10 inches square. Lay the base template on top, and use a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife to cut out the base. Peel off the scraps from the sides and reserve. Pick up the parchment with the base on it, put it on an unlined baking sheet and freeze while you finish cutting the other house pieces. Dust a third piece of parchment and the third piece of softened dough with flour. Roll the dough to about 1/4-inch thick and 11 by 7 inches. Put the roof and the front wall templates on top, and use the pizza cutter to cut the pieces. Transfer the pieces to the last prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out a door from the front wall. Combine the scrap pieces with the reserved scraps, and gently knead together on the parchment; flour, roll to 1/4 inch thick and about 8 by 9 inches and cut out the remaining walls. Transfer the pieces to the baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out windows from the walls. Freeze for 10 minutes before baking. Bake the house pieces until golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans front to back and bottom to top halfway through the baking time. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes. While the house pieces cool, dust the cookies with sanding sugar if using, and bake until very light golden brown, about 16 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to completely, about 30 minutes. To assemble the house: Put 1/3 cup royal icing in a pastry bag fitted with the larger pastry tip. Place the roof browned-side up on a work surface with one of the short sides facing you. Pipe a thick 5-inch line of frosting along the short side 1 inch in from the edge. Let the icing harden while you build the rest of the house. (This will prevent the roof of the house from sliding off.) Put the base on a large platter or board on which it will be displayed. Next, assemble the house using the royal icing as glue and making sure to turn the walls lighter-sides out: Hold up one of the side walls and pipe a line of icing along the bottom and up both sides. Set it down while you hold up the back wall and pipe a line of icing along its bottom edge. Stick these two pieces together on the base with the icing, pressing them gently together so they adhere. Hold the pieces for a few seconds, until they can stand on their own. Repeat with the other side wall and the front wall, pressing all four walls together. Reserve the royal icing in the pastry bag. Whisk water about 1 teaspoon at a time into the rest of the icing to thin it slightly to the consistency of molasses. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with the smaller pastry tip. To decorate the house: Decorate the walls as desired: Use the thin icing for piping lines and decorations and for decorating the cookies. Use the thick icing to glue heavy pieces of candy to the sides and roof of the house. To make a grassy yard, spread a thin layer of icing with a butter knife around the base of the house. Press some of the coconut grass into the icing. Put some coconut grass inside the house (you dont need to ice inside). Decorate the yard as desired. Fill the house with candy and cookies (make sure the icing has set). Set the roof on top, lighter-side up (dont attach it), and decorate as desired. Combine 2 cups of the confectioners sugar and the meringue powder with a fork in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. (Alternatively, use a hand mixer and medium bowl.) Add 3 tablespoons of water, and mix on low speed until smooth and thick, with a consistency like caulk. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 3 minutes.) If the icing seems a bit loose, mix in a tablespoon of confectioners sugar at a time until thickened. Transfer to a clean bowl, and lay a damp piece of paper towel on top. Cover tightly until ready to use. Toss half the coconut and 3 drops food coloring with a fork in a medium bowl until the coconut is uniformly green. Add the remaining coconut, and toss gently to combine. Cover tightly and set aside.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: My Favorite Fajitas. Ingredients: 1 1/2 pounds Smoked Skirt Steak, recipe follows, 2 teaspoons cumin seeds, 2 limes, 3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, 2 large red onions, peeled, halved and cut into 1/4-inch strips, 2 large green bell peppers, cored, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips, 2 large red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch strips, Kosher salt, 8 flour tortillas, Smoky-Spicy Salsa, recipe follows, or your own favorite homemade or store-bought salsa, for serving, Sour cream, for serving, Instructions: Smoke the skirt steak according to the directions below. To make the marinade: while the steak is cooling, toast the cumin seeds in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking the constantly so they dont burn or stick, just until they are fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let them cool, Squeeze the juice from the limes into 1-gallon heavy plastic resealable bag. Add the cumin seeds, garlic, salt, and the pepper flakes and swish the marinade around to dissolve the salt. Slip the cooled steaks into the marinade, press out most of the air from the bag, and seal the bag very tightly. Refrigerate the beef for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day, turning the bag several times. To prepare the accompaniments, heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep, skillet over medium heat. Stir in the red onions and cook, stirring often, until they are wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the green peppers and cook until they are wilted enough t make room for the red peppers. Add the red peppers, season the vegetables lightly with salt and adjust the heat to low. Cook, stirring often, until tender, about 20 minutes. The vegetables can be prepared several hours in advance. Reheat them over low heat just before serving. To prepare the fajitas indoors: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil. Reheat the vegetables if necessary. Drain the steak well and discard the marinade. Heat a lightly oiled large grill pan or heavy skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Cook the steak, turning once, just until seared on both sides, about 5 minutes. At this point the steak will be about medium-rare. Turn off the heat and continue cook in the hot pan for a more well-done steak. Remove the steak from the skillet to a carving board and let it rest about 5 minutes. Pop the tortillas into the oven and let them warm while the steak is resting. To prepare the fajitas on a charcoal or gas grill: Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil. Reheat the vegetables if necessary, using a corner of the grill if there is room. Drain the steak well and discard the marinade. Cook the steak on the hottest part of the grill until both sides are well browned, about 6 minutes. The steak at this point will be about medium-rare, move the steak to a cooler part of the grill and continue to cook it for a more well-done steak. Remove the steak to a carving board and let it rest about 5 minutes. Set the tortilla on a moderately hot part of the grill and let them warm, turning once or twice, while the steak rests. To serve: Cut the steak crosswise into thin slices and pile the slices on a serving plate. Serve the vegetables directly from the skillet or scoop them into a serving bowl. Pass the tortillas, salsa, sour cream, steak, and vegetables around the table and let everyone dress their own fajitas as they like. 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons hickory, alder or oak wood chips, soaked 1 (1 to 1 1/4-pound) skirt steak, halved crosswise Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper or 2 teaspoons Southwestern Rub, recipe follows Prepare stovetop smoker with soaked wood chips according to manufacturers instructions. Trim any excess fat from the surface of the steak and cut the steak in half crosswise. Season the skirt steak with a generous rubbing of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper or Southwestern rub. One end of the steak will be considerably thinner and cook faster than the other half. If you would like to cook both halves to the same doneness, add the thinner pieces to the smoker after the thicker pieces have been smoking for about 8 minutes. If you are not planning to finish the steak on the grill as described above, smoke the halves until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each half registers 125 degrees F. for a medium-rare steak, about 24 minutes after closing the smoker lid, longer for more well done steaks. (Skirt steaks are a little tricky to check for doneness with an instant-read thermometer. Poke the thickest part of the steak with the thermometer in a few places, aiming for the center of the steak.) If you do plan to grill the steak after smoking, cook the steaks to a temperature of 100 to 105 degrees F, which will take about 18 minutes. The steaks can be smoked up to 2 days before grilling them. Yield: 4 servings 8 smoked Plum Tomatoes, recipe follows 1 large poblano or 3 jalapenos, stemmed and finely diced 1/2 small red onion, finely diced (about 1/4 cup) 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves Kosher salt Smoke the tomatoes according to the directions below. Cool them to room temperature. Peel off as much of the skins as will come off easily. Chop the tomatoes coarsely and toss them together with the chiles, red onion and cilantro in a bowl. Season with salt to taste. The salsa improves if it stands at room temperature for about half an hour before serving. You can refrigerate the salsa for up to one day. Bring it to room temperature and drain off any liquid before serving. Yield: 3 cups 2 tablespoons hickory or mesquite wood chips, soaked 8 plum tomatoes Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Prepare stovetop smoker with soaked wood chips according to manufacturers instructions. Cut the cored from the tomatoes with a paring knife then cut the tomatoes in half through the core end. Squeeze out the seeds and juice. Line the tomato halves side by side and cut side up on the smoking rack. Season the cut side of the tomatoes with a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Smoke until the tomatoes are softened, but not mushy; 10 minutes over the heat after closing the smoker lid and about 20 minutes off the heat with the smoker lid closed. Check the tomatoes for doneness after theyve been standing off the heat for 10 minutes. Serve smoked tomatoes as a side dish with just about any grilled or roasted meat, or seafood dish. Yield: 4 servings 3 whole dried cayenne chiles or 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 2 tablespoons coriander seeds 4 tablespoons cumin seeds 2 teaspoons kosher salt Snap the stems off the dried peppers, if using them. For a milder rub, tap out and discard the seeds. Crumble all the peppers into a small saucepan and add the coriander and cumin seeds. Toast the mix over low heat, stirring constantly, until the seeds are lightly browned and little wisps of smoke rise from the pan. Pour the spices onto a plate and cool them to room temperature. Grind them to a powder in a spice mill. Store the rub in an airtight jar in a cool, dark place for up to two weeks. Yield: 4 tablespoons","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Stollen. Ingredients: 1/2 cup (4 ounces) whole milk, 1/2 cup (2.25 ounces) all-purpose flour, 4 teaspoons (.44 ounce) instant yeast, 1 cup (6 ounces) golden raisins, plus additional for sprinkling on final dough, 1 cup (6 ounces) candied fruit mix, plus additional for sprinkling on final dough, 1/2 cup (4 ounces) brandy, rum, or schnapps, 1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) orange or lemon extract, 2 1/4 cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon (.5 ounce) sugar, 3/4 teaspoon (.19 ounce) salt, 1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) grated orange zest (optional), 1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) grated lemon zest (optional), 1 teaspoon (.25 ounce) ground cinnamon, 1 large (1.65 ounces) egg, 5 tablespoons (2.5 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature, About 1/4 cup (2 ounces) water, 1/2 cup (2 ounces) slivered blanched almonds (or marzipan, see Commentary), Vegetable oil or melted butter for topping, Powdered sugar for topping, Instructions: Make the sponge by warming the milk to about 100F. Whisk in the flour and yeast. Cover with plastic wrap and ferment for 1 hour, or until the sponge is very foamy and ready to collapse when tapped. Meanwhile, combine 1 cup each of the raisins and fruit mix, the brandy, and the orange extract. Set aside. To make the dough, in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), stir together the flour, sugar, salt, orange and lemon zests, and cinnamon. Then stir in (or mix in on low speed with the paddle attachment) the sponge, egg, butter, and enough water to form a soft, but not sticky, ball. This should take about 2 minutes. When the dough comes together, cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Add in the fruit and mix it with your hands (or on low speed) to incorporate. Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mixing with the dough hook) to distribute the fruit evenly, adding additional flour if needed. The dough should feel soft and satiny, tacky but not sticky. Knead for approximately 6 minutes (4 minutes by machine). Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Ferment at room temperature for 45 minutes. The dough will rise somewhat but will not double in size. Sprinkle flour lightly on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. If you are making 2 loaves, divide the dough in half. Proceed in one of the following ways. Method 1: Roll out the dough into a 9 by 6-inch rectangle (7 by 5-inch rectangle for 2 smaller loaver) and sprinkle the slivered almonds and additional fruit over the top. Roll the dough up into a batard, as shown on page 73, sealing the crease by pinching the dough with the edge of your hand. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment. Transfer the stollen to the pan and, as you set the dough down, curl it into a slight crescent. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Proof for approximately 1 hour at room temperature, or until the dough is 1 1/2 times its original size. Preheat the oven to 350F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Bake the stollen for 20 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue to bake for 20 to 50 minutes, depending on the size of the loaves. The bread will bake to a dark mahogany color, should register 190F in the center of the loaf, and should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and brush the top with vegetable oil while still hot. Immediately tap a layer of powdered sugar over the top through a sieve or sifter. Wait for 1 minute, then tap another layer over the first. The bread should be coated generously with the powdered sugar. Let cool for at least 1 hour before serving. When completely cool, store in a plastic bag. Or, leave them out uncovered overnight to dry out slightly, German style. This shaping method results in more of a blanket-in-the-manger look. With your hands, form the dough into a thick rectangle, 8 by 4 inches (5 by 3 inches for 2 smaller loaves), and dust it with flour. (A) Sprinkle the top with slivered almonds and extra fruit. (B) Take a small rolling pin and press down on the center of the rectangle, then roll the dough in the center only, leaving 1 inch at both the top and the bottom edges as thick as the original rectangle. The new rectangle, with its thick top and bottom edges, should be 12 inches wide by 6 inches long (8 by 5 inches for 2 loaves). The interior of the rectangle should be about 1/2 inch thick. Using a pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the counter, lift the top edge and bring it down and over the bottom edge, going just past the bottom edge. The thin inside part of the rectangle should remain behind the bottom edge. (C) Turn the dough seam side up and tuck additional slivered almonds and fruit under the dough flap. (D) Fold the top edge back over the bottom edge and rest it on the thin center section. Tuck more almonds and fruit under the new fold. The dough should have a folded, layered look, with fruit and almonds peeking out both sides. Gently squeeze the loaf to press it together. Rich, standard dough; indirect method; commercial yeast 1 hour sponge; 20 minutes mixing; 2 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 50 to 70 minutes baking This version (and there are hundreds of authentic versions of stollen) is particularly good because it not only tastes great, but it also can be made in a reasonable amount of time, about 4 hours from start to finish. This is because of the strong sponge that leavens the rather heavy dough at a brisk pace. Of course, if you want to do it right, soak the fruit a few days ahead of time in brandy or schnapps. This improves the flavor and preserves the bread for weeks. Heres how: Two days before making this bread, soak the raisins and candied fruit in the brandy, rum, or schnapps and the orange or lemon extract, tossing the fruit a few times a day until the liquid is absorbed. If youd prefer not to use alcohol, you can double the amount of extract and add 1/2 cup of water. You can also simply add the fruit, without the alcohol, into the final dough and add the extract directly to the dough. A German friend, chef Heinz Lauer, told me he prefers to let his stollen dry out for a few days or even weeks before eating it. He cuts off thin, hard slices and dips them in wine or coffee, almost like biscotti. I tend to prefer it fresh from the oven. Heinz also told me he prefers his stollen with a marzipan center. This is a common variation, and if you like this intensely flavored sweetened almond paste, as I do, you may replace the slivered almonds in the formula with a thick band of marzipan rolled into the center of the loaf. You can substitute regular dried fruit, such as dried cranberries or apricots, for the candied fruit, if you prefer.

"Recipe Name: New Zealand Almond and Fig Bread. Ingredients: 3/4 cup/ about 4 ounces/ 117 grams bread flour, 1/2 teaspoon/ 1.6 grams instant yeast, 3/4 teaspoon/ 3.1 grams sugar, 3/4 liquid cup/ 6.2 ounces/ 177 grams water, at room temperature (70F to 90F), 3/4 cup/ 4 ounces/ 117 grams bread flour, plus 2 tablespoons/ 0.6 ounce/ 19 grams for kneading, 1/2 cup/ 2.5 ounces/ 72 grams whole wheat flour, 1/2 teaspoon/ 1.6 grams instant yeast, 2 teaspoons/ 9 grams oil, 1 1/4 teaspoons/ 0.25 ounce/ 8.3 grams salt, 1 cup/ 2.6 ounces/ 75 grams unblanched slivered (not sliced) or whole almonds, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup/ 2.6 ounces/ 75 grams dried Mission figs, stems removed, cut into 1/4 -to 1/2 -inch pieces, plus 1 whole fig for decor, 1 cup/ 2.6 ounces/ 75 grams sliced almonds, 3 tablespoons/ 1.75 ounces/ 50 grams apricot jelly, 2 tablespoons/ 1 ounce/ 30 grams water, La Cloche Bread Baker OR a half sheet pan, either one lined with a nonstick liner such as Silpain or parchment, or sprinkled with flour or cornmeal, A baking stone OR baking sheet, Instructions: Oven Temperature: 425F, then 375F (if using La Cloche, 450F, then 400F) Make the sponge. In a mixer bowl or other large bowl, place the flour, yeast, sugar and water. Whisk until very smooth, to incorporate air, about 2 minutes. The sponge will be the consistency of a thick batter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl Set it aside, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the flour mixture. Combine the ingredients for the flour mixture and add to the sponge. In a medium bowl, whisk together the bread flour (reserve 1/4 cup if mixing by hand), whole wheat flour, and yeast. Sprinkle this on top of the sponge and cover it tightly with plastic wrap. Allow it to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature. (During this time the sponge will bubble through the flour mixture in places; this is fine.) Mix the dough. Mixer Method: Add the oil and mix with the dough hook on low speed (#2 if using a KitchenAid) until the flour is moistened enough to form a rough dough. Scrape down any bits of dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes. Sprinkle on the salt and knead the dough on medium speed (#4 KitchenAid) for 7 minutes. It will be smooth and shiny and cling slightly to your fingers, If it is still very sticky, knead in a little flour. If it is not at all sticky, spray it with a little water and knead it in. (It will weigh about 17 ounces/ 490 grams.) Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and roll it into a rectangle about 9 inches by 14 inches. Sprinkle with the chopped almonds and cut-up figs. Roll up the dough and knead it for a few minutes to incorporate the almonds and figs evenly. Shape it into a ball. Hand Method: Add the oil and salt and, with a wooden spoon or your hand, mix until the flour is moistened. Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved 1/4 cup of flour as possible to keep it from sticking. use a bench scraper to scrape the dough and gather it together as you knead it. At this point, it will be very sticky. Cover it with the inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. (This resting time will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with.) Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic. It should still be moist enough to cling slightly to your fingers. If it is very sticky, add some of the remaining reserved flour, or a little extra. (The dough will weigh about 17 ounces/490 grams.) Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a rectangle about 9 inches by 14 inches, and sprinkle with the almonds and cut-up figs. Roll up the dough and knead it for a few minutes to incorporate the almonds and figs evenly. Shape it into a ball. Both Methods: Let the dough rise. Set the dough in a 4-quart dough-rising container or bowl, lightly greased with cooking spray or oil. Press down the dough and lightly spray or oil the top. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap. With a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at approximately where double the height of the dough would be. Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75F to 80F) until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough out into a floured counter, and press down on it gently to form a rectangle. Fold the dough into a tight package or give it 2 business letter turns, and set it back in the container. Oil the surface again, cover, and mark where double the height of the dough would now be. It will fill the container fuller than before because it is puffier with air. Allow the dough to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Shape the dough, encrust it with almonds, and let it rise. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and press down on it gently to flatten it slightly. Round the dough into a 4 1/2 -inch ball and lightly spray or brush the surface with water. Scatter the almonds on a counter. Roll the ball of dough in the almonds to cover it completely, pressing the nuts into the dough. Firmly push the whole fig, pointed end down, into the center so that it is submerged as deeply as possible into the dough. The loaf will measure 5 inches by 1 1/2 -inches high. Place it on the baking sheet or the La Cloche base. Cover it with a large container, or cover loosely with oiled plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. It will be about 5 1/2 inches by 3 inches high, and when it is pressed gently with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill in. press any remaining almonds into the empty spaces created by the doughs expansion. Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 425F, or 450F if using La Cloche, 1 hour before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place an oven stone or baking sheet on before preheating. If using La Cloche, preheat the dome along with the oven. Bake the bread. If using La Cloche, carefully place the hot dome onto the base and quickly but gently set it on the hot stone or hot baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the temperature to 400F and continue baking for 30 to 35 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 190F). Alternatively, quickly but gently set the baking sheet on the hot stone or hot baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes. Lower the temperature to 375F and continue baking for 35 to 40 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 190F.) If the nuts begin to brown, tent the loaf loosely with aluminum foil. Halfway through baking, turn the pan around for even baking. Glaze the bread. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, mix the apricot jelly and water together. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. With a spoon, press the preserves through a strainer to make a smooth glaze. When the bread is done, remove it from the oven and brush It with the hot apricot glaze. Return it to the oven for 1 minute to set the glaze. Cool the bread. Remove the bread from the oven and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Ultimate Full Flavor Variation: For the best flavor development, in Step 2, allow the sponge to ferment for 1 hour at room temperature, then refrigerate it for 8 to 24 hours. If using the hand mixing method, remove it from the refrigerator about 1 hour before mixing the dough.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Tunisian Lamb-and-Eggplant Stew with Farro, Parsley, and Harissa. Ingredients: 1 tablespoon caraway seeds, 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, 3 pounds lamb shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-to-2-inch chunks, 6 cloves garlic, smashed, 3 chiles de arbol, crumbled, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 cups diced onion, 2 bay leaves, fresh if possible, 3/4 cup San Marzano canned tomatoes, crushed, 1/2 cup lemon juice, 2 1/2 cups veal stock, 2 1/2 cups chicken stock, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon allspice berries, tied in cheesecloth, 2 medium eggplants, Farro with parsley and butter (recipe follows), Harissa (recipe follows), 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup diced onion, 1 tablespoon thyme leaves, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 chiles de arbol, crumbled, 1 bay leaf, preferably fresh, 1 1/2 cups farro (spelt), 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into cubes, 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 6 dried ancho chiles, seeded, membranes removed, 1/3 cup San Marzano canned tomatoes, 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 clove garlic, chopped, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, A healthy pinch cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sherry vinegar, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 lemon, for juicing, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, Instructions: Toast the caraway seeds in a small pan for a few minutes, until the seeds release their aroma and darken slightly. Using a mortar and pestle, pound the seeds coarsely. Repeat with the coriander. Place the lamb in a large bowl with the caraway, coriander, smashed garlic, chiles, paprika, cayenne, and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Using your hands, toss the lamb, spices, and oil together to coat the meat well. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Take the meat out of the refrigerator 45 minutes before cooking. After 15 minutes, season it on all sides with 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons salt and lots of pepper. Reserve the garlic. Preheat the oven to 325F. Heat a large Dutch oven over high heat for 3 minutes. Pour in 3 tablespoons olive oil and wait a minute or two, until the pan is very hot, almost smoking. Place the meat in the pan, being careful not to crowd it. (You will most likely need to do this in two batches.) Sear the meat until its well browned and caramelized on all sides. (This step is very important and should not be rushed; it may take15 to 20 minutes.) As the batches of meat are browned, remove them to a baking sheet or platter. Turn the heat down to medium and add the onion, bay leaves, and reserved garlic. Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the crusty bits left in the pan. Cook about 5 minutes, until the onions are caramelized. Add the crushed tomatoes and lemon juice and cook 2 minutes, stirring continuously to coat the onions. Add the stocks, cinnamon, and allspice. Bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the lamb and its juices to the pot. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and a tight-fitting lid, if you have one. Braise the lamb in the oven about 3 hours. While the lamb is braising, cut the eggplant into 1-inch cubes. Toss them with salt, and place them in a colander for 10 minutes to drain. Pat the eggplant cubes dry with paper towels. Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Swirl in 3 tablespoons olive oil, and wait 1 minute. Add the eggplant to the pan, and let sear a minute or two. (Do not crowd the pan; you may need to do this in batches.) Once it starts to color, turn the eggplant cubes to achieve a nice color on all sides. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, until tender and golden. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. To check the meat for doneness, carefully remove the lid and foil, being mindful of the hot steam. Spoon a piece of meat out of the pan and press it with your thumb or a spoon. If its done, it will yield easily and almost fall apart. If its not super-tender, cover again and return the pot to the oven. When the meat is done, remove from the oven and turn the temperature up to 400F. Ladle most of the braising juices into a strainer set over a saucepan, leaving an inch or two of juices in the pan with the lamb. Press down on the vegetables with the ladle to extract all the juices. Discard the cinnamon stick and allspice. Return the lamb to the oven for about 15 minutes, to caramelize it. Skim the fat from the braising juices. Reduce the broth over medium-high heat to thicken it slightly, if necessary. Taste for seasoning. Stir the eggplant in with the browned lamb, and pour the hot broth over the top, stirring to coat well. Transfer the farro onto a large warm platter. Spoon the braised lamb, along with the eggplant and cooking juices, over the farro. Dollop the harissa over the meat, scatter the parsley on top, and serve the remaining harissa and braising juices on the side. Heat a medium saucepan over high heat for 1 minute. Swirl in the olive oil, and add the diced onion, thyme, cinnamon stick, chiles, and bay leaf. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often, until the onion is translucent. Add the farro, stirring to coat it with the oil, and toast it slightly. Add 8 cups water and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, and simmer about 30 minutes, until the farro is tender and just cooked through. Drain the farro and discard the cinnamon stick, chiles, and bay leaf. Toss the hot farro with the butter. When all the butter has melted, stir in the parsley and a few grindings of black pepper. Taste for seasoning. Heat a large saute pan over high heat for 1 minute. Add the chiles to the pan and dry-toast them for a few minutes until they are blistered and slightly darkened. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with very hot water. Let them sit, covered, 15 minutes. Return the pan to the stove and add the tomato. Cook over medium heat for a few minutes until the juices reduce and the tomato is slightly darkened. Meanwhile, toast the cumin in a small pan over medium heat 2 to 3 minutes, until the seeds release their aroma and darken slightly. Pound them coarsely in a mortar. Drain the chiles well and place them in a food processor with the garlic, tomatoes, paprika, cumin, cayenne, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Puree until well combined. With the motor running, slowly pour in the olive oil and blend until incorporated. Season with a healthy squeeze of lemon juice, and more salt if you like. The lamb, like all braises, can be made a day or even 2 days ahead of time. Remember to marinate it overnight before braising. The harissa can also can be made ahead, and keeps for a few weeks in the refrigerator. Make the farro within an hour of serving. I like it best just after its been cooked and tossed with the butter. Hold it in a warm oven for up to 30 minutes, if thats more convenient for you.","```cypher

"Recipe Name: Heavenly Chiffon Cake (with Lots of Tips). Ingredients: 160 grams egg white, 40 grams castor sugar, 5 grams cornstarch, 1 grams lemon juice (or salt), 65 grams egg yolk, 20 grams castor sugar, 30 grams vegetable oil, 45 grams milk (or water), 70 grams cake flour, Instructions: This moist, finely textured crumb is like silk. Preparation: bring the milk and egg yolks to room temperature. Leave the egg whites in the refrigerator until its ready to use. Sift the flour, and then mix with a whisk. *Tip 1: The reason for mixing the sifted flour with a whisk it to incorporate plenty of air. Its just like sifting it twice, but easier. *Tip 2: Eggs vary in size, so in order to create the same cake reliably every time, I weigh them. Put a baking sheet in the oven, and preheat to 340F/170C. To make the meringue: Beat the egg whites lightly with a handheld egg beater, then add all the sugar. *Tip 3: The reason for adding the sugar all at once is to make it absorb as much of the moisture of the egg whites as possible, to create a soft, finely textured and sturdy meringue. *Tip 4: It takes more time to whisk than adding the sugar in batches, but you can create a very finely textured, high quality meringue this way. Start beating the egg whites and sugar at high speed, until the meringue forms very soft peaks. Add the cornstarch (or lemon juice). Beat at low speed to incorporate it evenly. *Tip 5: Cornstarch absorbs the moisture of the egg whites and stabilizes the foamy texture of the meringue. *Tip 6: Lemon juice and salt also make the meringue finely textured and stable. When the meringue forms soft peaks as shown here, its good. *Tip 7: If you beat the meringue for too long so that it forms very stiff peaks, its hard to incorporate the rest of the ingredients, and you end up losing some of the bubbles. Make the yolk batter: Beat the yolks lightly to break them up, and add all the sugar at once. Mix in low speed until the sugar is incorporated into the yolks. *Tip 8: Theres no need to whisk it until its pale and thick. Youll lose the incorporated air when you add the oil and milk anyway. Add the oil, and beat it in. Add the milk, and mix it in also. If everything is well mixed as shown here, its good. Mix up the flour with a whisk again to incorporate more air, then add all the yolk batter. Mix with a whisk until it is no longer floury. When the batter is smooth and thick as shown here its done. Chiffon batter has a high moisture content, so you can beat it hard. *Tip 9: Unlike regular spongecakes, if you beat it very well and develop the gluten in the flour, the cake will be not only be soft, it will be nice and bouncy too. Mix up meringue with a whisk to incorporate any water, which may have seeped out. Put a scoop of meringue into the batter and mix it in well with a whisk. Dont worry about the air bubble disappearing. *Tip 10:The first addition of meringue is a sacrifice, in order to make it easier to incorporate the rest into the batter. It looks like this. Change to a rubber spatula. Add 1/3 of the remaining meringue, and fold it in to the batter, scooping up from the bottom. and turning the bowl. When its just about mixed, incorporate 1/2 of the remaining meringue in the same way. Finally, add the batter into the bowl with the rest of the meringue. *Tip 11: From the 2nd addition of meringue onwards, work carefully so as not to lose the air bubbles as much as possible. The batter now looks like this. Its smooth, shiny and airy. Pour the batter into the cake tin from about a 15cm height. If you pour it from too high up, youll create big air bubbles. Hold the cake tin from both sides with the bottom on the countertop, and rotate it back and forth to smooth out the surface. Dont hit the tin on your work surface as other cake recipes dictate. *Tip 12: Hitting the cake tin onto a hard surface to eliminate air bubbles works for sturdy cake batters, but it doesnt work well for light batters, very creamy batters or batters with added ingredients like chocolate chips. *Tip 13: With a very light soft batter like this one, even the smallest shock will pop some of the small bubbles, and you may even end up introducing large bubbles. Put the cake in the oven and bake. I baked the cake for 27 minutes. The texture is moist and amooth, just like chiffon. *Tip 14: If you bake it for 30 minutes, check for doneness with a bamboo skewer. If it comes out clean, its well baked and stable, so you can cover it with whipped cream. *Tip 15: If you want to add fruits or chestnut cream after covering the cake with whipped cream, bake for 30 minutes at 360F/180C. Youll have a firm cake that can withstand all that weight on top. 8 minutes into the baking time, take the cake out and make 5 1cm deep cuts spaced evenly over the surface of the cake. This ensures that the cake will rise nice and evenly. *Tip 16: This method is useful for ensuring that the cake cooks evenly too, especially when you want a firm texture. *Tip 17: By taking it out of the oven you are cooking the cake that is just starting to rise, so its important to work quickly. *Tip 18: If this seems too difficult or rushed for you, or if you have a difficult batter to deal with such as a thin or very creamy one, just skip this step. 27 minutes into baking, if you poke the cake with a skewer, little bits of the sponge are on it. This is fine. *Tip 19: Its often written that if the skewer comes out clean the cake is done, but this actually means the cake is overdone. The best method is to take it out just before the skewer comes out clean, and to let the cake continue cooking with residual heat. *Tip 20: If you let it bake for 30 minutes, the skewer will come out clean. ** NOTE: If youre using a 20 cm diameter cake tin, bake for 37 to 40 minutes at 340F/170C. It will puff up a lot, so be careful not to let it burn. To prevent the cake from shrinking, drop the cake tin onto a counter top lined with a kitchen towel from about 15cm to eliminate the hot air. Cool the cake upside down. When the tin is just a little warm when you touch it, put the whole thing in a plastic bag and leave to rest overnight. *Tip 21: By letting it rest overnight, the flavors will blend together. Its delicious when its freshly baked, but it may taste too sweet or not sweet enough. *Tip 22: By resting the cake, the texture will firm up, so it becomes harder to mess up when removing the cake from the tin. Remove the cake from the tin. Insert a knife in between the cake and the tin, make a small gap and go around once with the knife while moving it up and down. Go around the funnel in the middle with a metal or bamboo skewer, moving up and down while scraping against the funnel wall. Grab the funnel and invert the cake. Support the cake with the hand holding the funnel. Insert a knife between the bottom and the cake, and go around once while scraping against the bottom. Remove the hand thats holding on to the funnel, and its done. *Tip 23: The reason for using milk even though its a plain chiffon cake is because the natural sweetness and fragrance of the milk softens the eggy-ness, and makes the cake taste delicious. *Tip 24: If you are using water, use less than the milk. 10% of the milk volume is fat, which tends to toughen the crumb, so more milk is used than water. *Tip 25: Castor sugar (sugar or bakers sugar) absorbs and retains moisture well, so it mixes well in batters and helps to create a cake that stays moist for a long time.","```cypher
