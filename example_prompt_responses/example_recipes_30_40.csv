In a small pan, combine the oil with the chopped morel and warm over low heat until the oil reaches 125 to 135 degrees, or is warm to the touch. Allow to steep for two hours. Reserve. Remove the morel pieces from the oil after they have steeped. Discard the pieces. In another bowl, combine the vinegar, mustard and the seasonings and mix thoroughly. Gradually whisk in three-quarters of a cup of the morel oil or a bit more, depending on the acidity of the vinegar. Reserve. For the salad, tear the lettuce into bite-size pieces, wrap in a towel and refrigerate. In a small pot of lightly salted boiling water, add the peas and a little lemon juice and cook the peas for six to 10 minutes, until tender. Drain under cold running water and drain again. Reserve. Repeat the same process with the fava beans, adding the remaining lemon juice. Reserve. Repeat the process with the scallions, simmering them for one to two minutes. Drain thoroughly and reserve on paper towel. Repeat the process with the potatoes and cook for about 12 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and reserve in a covered pot. If the potatoes are larger than the size of a quarter, cut them in halves or quarters. In a small saucepan, heat the stock over medium heat, add the cleaned and trimmed morels and simmer for five to seven minutes, or until tender. Drain and reserve, saving the stock for some other use. To prepare the relish, chop the tomatoes very fine or pulse once or twice in a food processor. Add the cumin, oil and seasonings. If too thick, add a little of the reserved juice of the tomato and chill. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a large skillet, heat about one tablespoon of the remaining oil. Season the steak with kosher salt and pepper and raise the heat under the skillet. Sear the steak for about five minutes on each side, until lightly crusted and browned. Transfer the steak to the oven and bake for eight to 12 minutes, or until it is done to your preference. Let it rest while you cut the greens. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with enough vinaigrette to coat, then divide among four plates. Repeat the process with the vegetables and morels. Trim the fat from the steak and slice the meat into thin strips. Arrange the slices over the greens and vegetables in lattice fashion and sprinkle with chervil. Add a little of the tomato relish on the side of each plate and serve."
"Recipe Name: Thick & Rich Kabocha Squash Baked Pudding. Ingredients: 300 grams Kabocha squash (peeled, steamed), 30 grams Light brown sugar (other sugars are also OK), 3 tbsp Maple syrup (other syrups are also OK), 3 Eggs, 200 ml Heavy cream, 100 ml Milk, 2 to 3 drops Vanilla oil or extract, 100 grams Granulated sugar (white sugar also OK), 2 tbsp Water, 3 tbsp Boiling water, Instructions: Remove the squashs skin, and steam in the microwave or a pot until soft. Mash it. Add to the squash and mix together, in this order the following ingredients - light brown sugar and maple, eggs, heavy cream, and milk. Itll blend together quickly. Pour through a strainer. A fine strainer is the best. Around this time preheat your oven to 170C. For the second half of straining, if you stir with a whisk itll help things along. Throw away any squash strings left over in the strainer. You can use a blender or a food processor to mix things, but you can also mix just as well with a whisk. So I dont use them. Once youve finished straining add a few drops of the vanilla oil. Use the whisk or a spatula to lightly mix it in. Pour into containers of your choosing. Tap the bottom on your table to get rid of any bubbles (but not hard enough to spill any). Arrange on your baking pan. Once the preheating has finished put in your oven and add about 1 cm of hot water to the pan. Steam bake at 170C for 30 to 40 minutes. While its baking make the caramel sauce. Add the granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons of water to a thick pot and heat on medium heat. Itll start browning naturally from the outsides. Use the handles to twirl the liquid around in the pan. If you mix with the spatula from the beginning itll crystallize. Once its got a nice color stop the heat, hold a lid in one hand, use your other hand to quickly pour in the hot water, and then close the lid (thisll prevent it jumping out at you). This time I made the caramel as a topping, so I made it to be a bit runnier. Once the pudding has baked (if you can stick a toothpick in it and it comes out cleanly) top with the caramel sauce and its complete. Once its cooled down chill in the refrigerator. This time I used the squash seeds as a topping, but you dont have to. A thick and rich baked pudding. The pudding itself has a reserved sweetness, so its a great match with the sweet caramel sauce. If youre not topping with the caramel sauce then maybe you can add 10 to 20 g of sugar to the pudding mixture, whatever you like."

Ingredients: 1 cm thick slice of a 15 cm diameter cake Your favorite chocolate sponge cake, 1 youll use most of it Cherry compote, 1 Cherry compote syrup, 150 ml Heavy cream, 185 grams Cream cheese, 30 grams Sugar (fine granulated sugar), 55 grams Sweet chocolate (I used 56% cocoa), 1 tbsp Kirsch, 5 grams Gelatin powder, 25 ml Water, 35 grams Chocolate for garnishing, 80 grams Heavy cream, 30 grams Sweet chocolate, 1 Mint leaves, 1 Nappage (if you have it), Instructions: Line the bottom of the cake pan with the sponge cake, then brush a good amount of the cherry compote syrup over the top. Soak the powdered gelatin in water. Melt the cheese creams chocolate in a double boiler. Make the cheese cream. Whip the heavy cream until it is thick and forms soft peaks. Put into the refrigerator. Soften the cream cheese in the microwave for a bit, then thoroughly combine with the sugar in a bowl using a whisk. If its a bit hard to mix, use a rubber spatula to knead it, then switch back to the whisk. Once smooth, add the melted chocolate and mix well. Next, add the Kirsch and mix well. Dissolve the gelatin in a double boiler, then add it to the bowl. Quickly mix it in. Mix in the chilled heavy cream from Step 3 one half at a time until it is smooth and thick.

Place in the refrigerator as-is and let chill for at least 2 hours to set. While you wait, melt the decoration chocolate in a double boiler. Use a dough scraper to spread a thin layer of the tempered chocolate over kitchen parchment paper. Place in the refrigerator to harden, then use a knife or your hands to break it up into pieces. Return to the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Put the heavy cream for the decoration in a pot and heat over low heat. Once warm, turn off the heat and add the sweet chocolate. Stir while melting. Dont let it boil. Transfer to a bowl, then place the bowl in ice water to cool while mixing. Once cooled, put into the refrigerator until ready to use. While mixing, be careful not to make bubbles. Once Step 9s cake has firmed up well, remove from the pan. Whisk Step 13s cream until it forms firm peaks.

"Recipe Name: Demayo Chocolate Cake. Ingredients: 2 cups sugar, 1 cup cake flour, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process), 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 14 teaspoon salt, 1 cup low-fat buttermilk, 3 large eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 12 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm, 2 -3 tablespoons heavy cream (if needed), 34 cup unsalted butter, 2 cups half-and-half, 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 6 large egg yolks, 2 12 cups shredded unsweetened coconut (preferably unsulphured), 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut, 1 cup chopped pecans (for a little extra crunch), Instructions: MAKE CUSTARD FILLING FIRST:. Combine first 4 ingredients in a medium saucepan; bring to a full boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, and simmer about 1 minute. Whisk together egg yolks in a large bowl until well combined. Whisk about 1 cup hot cream mixture into yolks to temper them, then pour yolk mixture back into saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking often, until slightly thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and whisk in coconut, stirring until thoroughly combined. (As you stir, coconut will absorb custard, and filling will thicken.) Pour filling onto an 18- x 13-inch rimmed baking sheet, and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover with aluminum foil, and chill at least 2 hours, or until cool. MAKE CAKE:. Preheat oven to 350F Butter three 8- x 2-inch round cake pans. Line pans with parchment paper; butter paper. Sift first 6 ingredients into a 10-quart bowl (or the largest you have). Stir until well combined. Whisk together buttermilk, eggs, vanilla, and 1 cup room-temperature water in a medium bowl until just combined. Immediately add to flour mixture, and whisk until smooth, scraping down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add butter, and whisk until well combined. Batter will be thin. Divide batter evenly among prepared pans, gently shaking pans to level batter if necessary. Bake 16 to 19 minutes or until cakes are springy to the touch, start to pull away from sides of pans, and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. ASSEMBLY:. Let cakes cool in pans on cooling racks for 10 minutes, then invert onto racks, remove pans and parchment, and invert again so cakes are right side up. Place 1 cake layer on an 8-inch cardboard round or cake plate. Using a stiff offset metal spatula (the blade bends up where it meets the handle), spread one-third of chilled Custard Filling evenly over the top of the layer. (If filling seems too stiff, gradually stir in heavy cream to loosen it a bit.) Top with second cake layer, and spread another one-third of filling over the top. Place final cake layer on top, and spread with remaining filling, leaving sides bare. Sprinkle coconut over cake. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 2 to 3 days. Slice into hearty wedges, and serve a little cooler than room temperature. *After baking, cake layers can be assembled as described above or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and chilled up to 1 day or frozen up to 1 month."
