Spread out a sheet of plastic wrap and top with the rice from Step 1. Press it out into a thin layer. (Press it out with the side of a rice spatula.) Wrap the rice around the chopsticks, then wrap with shiso leaves to taste. (The picture shows no shiso on the bottom, 1 leaf on the middle, and 2 leaves on the top.) Spread the pork out on the plastic wrap, overlapping a little between the layers, and roll up the rice rolls from Step 3. Ready! Cook while rolling around on a grill.
